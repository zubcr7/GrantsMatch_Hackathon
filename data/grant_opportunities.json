        "description": "The Linguistics Program supports basic science in the domain of human language, encompassing investigations of the grammatical properties of individual human languages, and of natural language in general. Research areas include syntax, semantics, morphology, phonetics and phonology. The program encourages projects that are interdisciplinary in methodological or theoretical perspective, and that address questions that cross disciplinary boundaries, such as (but not limited to): What are the psychological processes involved in the production, perception, and comprehension of language? What are the computational properties of language and/or the language processor that make fluent production, incremental comprehension or rapid learning possible? How do the acoustic and physiological properties of speech inform our theories of natural language and/or language processing? What role does human neurobiology play in shaping the various grammatical properties of language? How does language develop in natural learning contexts across the life-span? What social and cultural factors underlie language variation and change? Because NSF&apos;s mandate is to support basic research, the Linguistics Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice or applied policy, nor does it support work to develop or assess pedagogical methods or tools for language instruction. The Linguistics Program accepts proposals for a variety of project types: research proposals from scholars with PhDs or equivalent degrees, proposals for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement (LING-DDRI) awards, and CAREER proposals. We will also consider proposals for conferences. Funding requests for conference support should be submitted in accordance with the Conference Proposals section of Chapter II of NSF&apos;s Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG). NSF&apos;s Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences (BCS), in partnership with the National Endowment for the Humanities and in collaboration with programs in other NSF Directorates, supports efforts to develop and advance knowledge and infrastructure that will enable the analysis of languages that are both understudied and at risk of falling out of use. In recognition of the critical relevance of these languages to understanding the range and limits of human linguistic and cultural variation, BCS accepts research and dissertation proposals in response to solicitations NSF Dynamic Language Infrastructure - NEH Documenting Endangered Languages (DLI-DEL) and Dynamic Language Infrastructure - Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DLI-DDRI).

        "description": "The aim of the PAC program is to support empirically grounded, theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in a wide range of topic areas related to human perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes and their interactions. The PAC program welcomes a wide range of perspectives and a variety of methodologies (including computational modeling if the goal is to expand explanatory theories of human perception, action, or cognition). PAC strongly encourages proposals that examine human behavior in realistic (or real-world) scenarios and that include varied subject population. It is expected that knowledge gained from PAC-supported projects will have a clear and direct path towards benefitting society. PAC is open to co-review of proposals submitted to other programs both within the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Directorate and across other directorates. Note: Proposals may be returned without review if the primary goal of the research is to understand (1) structure/function mappings between PAC processes and neural activity; (2) clinical populations per se; or (3) behavior of non-human animals without a clear and direct impact on our understanding of human perception, action or cognition. Before submitting a proposal, investigators are encouraged to email sbe-pac@nsf.gov with a one-page summary of the proposed research (modeled after the Project Summary page of a standard proposal and including a description of both Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts) in order to confirm appropriateness of the work for the PAC program. PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled &#8220;List of Suggested Reviewers&#8221; with their full proposal. Sharing of data and other materials is an expectation for funded research. Please consult the NSFDear Colleague Letter: Effective Practices for Data for more details. Interested in talking with a program director? Send a one-page description of the proposed research to sbe-pac@nsf.gov.",

        "description": "MCC is issuing this APS in order to develop partnerships with organizations that share compact and threshold program and MCC institutional goals and align with the needs of MCC&#8217;s current portfolio. MCC partnerships take many forms and benefit both MCC and our partner organizations by increasing our respective access to cutting-edge research, knowledge, data, technologies, networks and expertise, as well as co-funding. Partnerships can help open new markets, scale programs, drive innovation, and transform the lives of people around the world. Successful partnerships are expected to involve collaboration between MCC and partner staff and support MCC&#8217;s ability to achieve its mission and programmatic goals. Partnerships must concentrate on priority development activities which fall within MCC&#8217;s mission of poverty reduction through economic growth and align with its core principles of results, good policies, and accountability. MCC funds activities in the public sector where the government role is clear and preeminent, but through partnership hopes to draw more broadly on non-governmental partners to stimulate additional investment and innovative development practices. MCC is seeking concept papers for the following partnership opportunities: 1. Empowering African Women through Data Skills &#8211; Due Date: Closed 2.

        "description": "Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence (SL) supports potentially transformative research that develops basic theoretical insights and fundamental knowledge about principles, processes and mechanisms of learning, and about augmented intelligence &#8212; how human cognitive function can be augmented through interactions with others or with technology, or through variations in context. The program supportsresearch addressing learning in individuals and in groups, across a wide range of domains at one or more levels of analysis, including molecular and cellular mechanisms; brain systems; cognitive, affective and behavioral processes; and social and cultural influences. The program also supports research on augmented intelligence that clearly articulates principled ways in which human approaches to learning and related processes, such as in design, complex decision-making and problem-solving, can be improved through interactions with others or through the use of artificial intelligence in technology. These could include ways of using knowledge about human functioning to improve the design of collaborative technologies that have the capacity to learn to adapt to humans. For both aspects of the program, there is special interest in collaborative and collective models of learning and intelligence that are supported by the unprecedented speed and scale of technological connectivity.This includes emphasis on how people and technology working together in new ways and at scale can achieve more than either can attain alone. The program also seeks explanations for how the emergent intelligence of groups, organizations and networks intersects with processes of learning, behavior and cognition in individuals. Projects that are convergent or interdisciplinary may be especially valuable in advancing basic understanding of these areas, but research within a single discipline or methodology is also appropriate.Connections between proposed research and specific technological, educational and workforce applications will be considered as valuable broader impacts but are not necessarily central to the intellectual merit of proposed research. The program supports a variety of approaches, including experiments, field studies, surveys, computational modeling, and artificial intelligence or machine learning methods. Examples of general research questions within scope of Science of Learning and Augmented Intelligence (SL)include: What are the underlying mechanisms that support transfer of learning from one context to another or from one domain to another?How is learning generalized from a small set of specific experiences?What is the basis for robust learning that is resilient against potential interference from new experiences?How is learning consolidated and reconsolidated from transient experience to stable memory? How do human interactions with technologies, imbued with artificial intelligence, provide improved human task performance?What models best describe the interplay of the individual and collaborative processes that lead to co-creation of knowledge and collective intelligence? In what ways do the capacities and constraints of human cognition inform improved methods of human-artificial intelligence collaboration? How can we integrate research findings and insights across levels of analysis, relating understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning in the neurons, to circuit and systems-level computations of learning in the brain, to cognitive, affective, social and behavioral processes of learning? What is the relationship between assembly of new networks (development) and learning new knowledge in a maturing or mature brain?

        "description": "This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications for P30 Cancer Center Support Grants (CCSGs) to support NCI-designated Cancer Centers. CCSGs support two types of cancer centers: 1) Comprehensive Cancer Centers, which demonstrate reasonable depth and breadth of research activities in each of three major areas: basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, control and population-based research, and which have substantial transdisciplinary research that bridges these scientific areas; and 2) Cancer Centers, which are primarily focused on basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, cancer control, and population-based research; or some combination of these areas. The purpose of both types of NCI-designated Cancer Centers is to capitalize on all institutional cancer research capabilities, integrating meritorious programs in laboratory, clinical, and population research into a single transdisciplinary research enterprise across all institutional boundaries. Cancer Centers supported through this FOA are expected to serve as major sources of discovery of the nature of cancer and of development of more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and therapy; to contribute significantly to the development of shared resources that support research; to collaborate and coordinate their research efforts with other NCI-funded programs and investigators; and to disseminate research findings for the benefit of the community.",

Research areas include syntax, linguistic semantics and pragmatics, morphology, phonetics, and phonology. The program encourages projects that are interdisciplinary in methodological or theoretical perspective, and that address questions that cross disciplinary boundaries, such as (but not limited to): What are the psychological processes involved in the production, perception, and comprehension of language? What are the computational properties of language and/or the language processor that make fluent production, incremental comprehension or rapid learning possible? How do the acoustic and physiological properties of speech inform our theories of language and/or language processing? What role does human neurobiology play in shaping the various components of our linguistic capacities? How does language develop in children? What social and cultural factors underlie language variation and change? The Linguistics Program does not make awards to support clinical research projects, nor does it support work to develop or assess pedagogical methods or tools for language instruction.

        "description": "The far-reaching impact and rate of innovation in the computer and information science and engineering &#64257;elds has been remarkable, generating economic prosperity and enhancing the quality of life for people throughout the world. More than a decade ago, the National Science Foundation&#8217;s (NSF) Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) established the Expeditions in Computing (Expeditions) program to build on past successes and provide the CISE research and education community with the opportunity to pursue ambitious, fundamental research agendas that promise to de&#64257;ne the future of computing and information. In planning Expeditions projects, investigators are strongly encouraged to come together within or across departments or institutions to combine their creative talents in the identi&#64257;cation of compelling, transformative research agendas that look ahead by at least a decade and promise disruptive innovations in computer and information science and engineering for many years to come. Now funded at levels up to $15,000,000 for seven years, Expeditions projects represent some of the largest single investments currently made by the CISE directorate. Together with the Science and Technology Centers and the National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes that CISE supports, Expeditions projects form the centerpiece of the directorate&apos;s center-scale award portfolio. With awards funded at levels that promote the formation of large research teams, CISE recognizes that concurrent research advances in multiple &#64257;elds or sub-&#64257;elds are often necessary to stimulate deep and enduring outcomes. The awards made in this program will complement research areas supported by other CISE programs, which target particular computer and information science and engineering &#64257;elds. Additionally, CISE offers Innovation Transition (InTrans) awards for teams nearing the end of their Expeditions as well as Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Frontier projects. The goal of InTransis to continue the long-term vision and objectives of CISE&#8217;s center-scale projects. Through InTrans awards, CISE will provide limited funds to match industry support.",

USMA executes research to enhance the education of cadets, develop the faculty professionally, and address important issues facing the Army and the Nation. In addition, the Academy conducts research and analysis in emerging fields that may realize novel or vastly improved Army capabilities. At West Point, research is organized and administered through centers and institutes, most of which reside within academic departments. These centers and institutes, affiliated with each other through the Academy Research Council (ARC), coordinated and supported by the Academic Research Division (ARD), provide the infrastructure necessary to tackle the nation&#8217;s and the world&#8217;s most challenging problems. Our research centers and institutes bring context to the classroom, are central to our vibrant and pioneering faculty, and are one way West Point connects to the Army and to the Nation. Our students are driven, our faculty is world-class, and through our centers, scholars and scientists thrive and produce their best work. Cadets regularly win Best Paper Awards at national and international graduate-level conferences, our faculty hold fellowships and chairmanships in their discipline&apos;s national organizations and our products are deployed to the soldier. In addition to applied research, there are centers and institutes at West Point that focus on other aspects of the USMA mission.The USMA BAA identifies topics of interest to the USMA departments, directorates, and research centers and institutes. These groups focus on executing in-house research programs, with a significant emphasis on collaborative research with other organizations. The groups fund a modest amount of extramural research in certain specific areas, and those areas are described in this BAA.The USMA BAA seeks proposals from institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, foreign organizations, foreign public entities, and for-profit organizations (i.e., large and small businesses) for research based on the following campaigns: Socio-Cultural; Information Technology; Ballistics, Weapons, and Protections; Energy and Sustainability; Materials, Measurements, and Facilities; Unmanned Systems and Space; Human Support Systems; and Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Quantum Technologies.Proposals are sought for cutting-edge innovative research that could produce discoveries with a significant impact to enable new and improved Army technologies and related operational capabilities and related technologies. The specific research areas and topics of interest described in this document should be viewed as suggestive, rather than limiting.",

        "description": "The primary aim of the Mathematical Sciences Infrastructure Program is to foster the continuing health of the mathematical sciences research community as a whole. In addition,the program complements the Workforce Program in the Mathematical Sciences in its goal to increase the number of well-prepared U.S. based individuals who successfully pursue careers in the mathematical sciences and in other professions in which expertise in the mathematical sciences plays an increasingly important role. The DMS Infrastructure program invites projects that support core research in the mathematical sciences, including: 1) novel projects supporting research infrastructure across the mathematical sciences community; 2) training projects complementing the Workforce Program, and 3) conference, workshop, and travel support requests that include cross-disciplinary activities or have an impact at the national scale. Proposals under this solicitation submitted to DMS Infrastructure must show engagement in developing or enhancing the mathematical sciences research infrastructure in the U.S., including, but not limited to, broadening participation activities; professional development training; or involvement of students and early career researchers. Proposals must explain the regional or national scale impact of the activity that goes substantially beyond the submitting institution or the location of the event. Full proposals (with exception of conference proposals, which are subject to lead-time requirements) must be submitted close to one of the Full Proposal Target Dates. See below for more information about each category of Infrastructure projects. (1)Novel projects that serve to strengthen the research infrastructure: The DMS Infrastructure Program will consider novel projects that support and strengthen the research infrastructure across the mathematical sciences community. These projects most often cut across multiple sub-disciplines supported by DMS or involve interdisciplinary collaborations. The main goal of these projects should be to create a new research infrastructure or substantially enhance or transform an existing infrastructure with regional or national impact that goes substantially beyond the submitting institution or the location of the project. Full proposals must be submitted by the Full ProposalTarget Date. (2)Training projects: Training proposals submitted to DMS Infrastructure must not fit into one of the areas covered by solicitations in the Workforce Program in the Mathematical Sciences; they must be submitted by the Full ProposalTarget Date; and they must: A. Include a core research component for trainees in mathematical sciences; B. Demonstrate promise for an impact at the regional or national scale that goes substantially beyond the submitting institution or the location of the project; C. Satisfy at least one of the following criteria: i. Serve as models to be replicated,ii. Promote partnerships with non-academic entities, minority-serving institutions, or community colleges, oriii. Include a substantial broadening participation initiative. In addition, all proposals of this type must clearly identify: Goals to be achieved; Specific new activities to be conducted, the way in which these address the goals, and the way in which the activities significantly differ from or enhance common practice; Measurable outcomes for the project; Plans and methods for assessment of progress toward the goals to be achieved, and for evaluation of the success of the activity; Recruitment, selection, and retention plans for participants, including members of underrepresented groups; Sustainability plans to continue the pursuit of the project&apos;s goals when funding terminates; and A budget commensurate with the proposed activity. 3) Conferences, Symposia, Working Research Sessions, Travel Support Requests: Principal Investigators should carefully read the program solicitationConferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciencesto obtain important information regarding the substance of proposals for conferences, workshops, summer/winter schools, international travel support, and similar activities.Conference/workshop proposals that concern topics within a particular subdiscipline of mathematics or statistics should be submitted to the appropriate DMS disciplinary program(s). These submissions are subject to the lead-time requirements specified by the disciplinary program(s); see the program web pages listed on theDMS home page. Conference/workshop proposals may be submitted to the DMS Infrastructure program only if the intended topical areas span a wide range of the mathematical sciences and are consequently not within the scope of DMS disciplinary programs. The required lead time for submission of such proposals is: 6 months in advance of the meeting date for proposals requesting no more than $50,000 to support a domestic meeting; 9 months in advance of the meeting date for proposals requesting more than $50,000 to support a domestic meeting; 12 months in advance of the meeting date for proposals requesting support for participation in a meeting taking place outside the United States.

        "description": "The U.S. Army Research Office (ARO) in partnership with NSA&#8217;s Laboratory for Physical Science (LPS) is soliciting Incubator, Collaboration, and Fellowship research proposals for participation in the LPS Qubit Collaboratory (LQC). The mission of the LQC can be captured in three broad goals: 1) pursue disruptive fundamental research and enabling technologies with a focus on qubit development for quantum computing and other applications (such as sensing); 2) grow deep, collaborative partnerships to tackle the most difficult and relevant long-term problems in quantum information science and technology; and 3) build a quantum workforce of tomorrow through research experiences in government at LPS and at LQC partners. The LQC will offer a mechanism for collaborative research between LPS and academia, industry, FFRDCs, and Government Laboratories to advance foundational and transformative research on challenging problems that have hindered progress in quantum information processing and associated technologies.The goal of this BAA is to seek proposals that bring together expertise from the public and private sectors and their respective research infrastructures to advance solutions that may be best approached as a collaborative team. A Collaboratory is &#8220;a center without walls, in which the nation&#8217;s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, [and] accessing information in digital libraries. This BAA introduces LQC Research Thrusts (A.1.1) which are the technical areas of interest&#8212;which will be updated periodically&#8212;where partners of the LQC will pursue joint research with LPS through Incubator (A.1.2) and Collaboration (A.1.3) collaborative agreements. The LQC BAA also fulfills the Government&#8217;s overarching interest--through the proposed research and on-site research experiences--in creating and training a workforce in quantum science and technology, generating pathways of solutions that feed technology development, establishing partnerships, and creating transition opportunities. In further support of training through research, Section A.1.4 calls for Quantum Computing Research (QuaCR) Graduate and Postdoctoral Fellowships for US citizens working in areas of interest.Substantial progress on solving the most difficult and long-term Quantum Information Science &amp; Technology (QIST) research problems that unleash further rapid progress in the field will constitute LQC success. Examples of such research problems include (but are not limited to): limits of performance due to device design, material selection, and/or control, the exploration of alternative qubit physics (e.g., different approaches to qubit encoding or types of gates) and lowering of barriers to such approaches, advances in materials that improve qubit gate fidelity, reducing the overhead of classical components in quantum information technology and optimizing classical performance, and the exploration of applications of quantum technologies to new domains.Three categories of proposals are sought for this BAA:1.Incubator opportunities seek partnership proposals from single investigators and small research groups, including teaching colleges, who may have unique skillsets to contribute toward the pursuit of the research thrusts presented in A.1.1. Incubator proposals may also be the development of concepts into a detailed technical research approach to advance solution of problems of high interest to quantum information science research. Incubator proposals would avail themselves of the collaboration opportunities with LPS research staff and infrastructure made available at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences (LPS) to lay the groundwork for concepts that may be suitable for a Collaboratory proposal or responses to other DoD quantum information science research opportunities.2.Collaboratory proposals seek research proposals that bring together a strong significant collaboration--researchers from academia, industry, FFRDCs, and/or Government Laboratories--to pursue long-term projects focused on fundamental problems of interest to qubit development and/or associated science and technology. These collaborative groups will propose to work together in a focused manner for a period of time expected to be one to three years in order to demonstrate a proof-of-concept experiment and/or theory exploration to determine the feasibility of their creative idea.3.QuaCR Research Fellowship proposals seek to support talented U.S. citizen graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in the field of quantum information processing (primary interest) and quantum sensing (secondary interest). Applicants with a background from either within or outside QIS are encouraged. The proposed research areas are described in this BAA and must enhance active Quantum Information Science research efforts being supported by the Army Research Office and/or LPS. Research fellows are encouraged to complete an LPS Internship during their graduate career or visit during their postdoctoral fellowship",

        "description": "The EDU Core Research (ECR) program offers this ECR:Core solicitation and invites proposals for fundamental research (curiosity-driven basic research and use-inspired basic research) that contributes to the general, explanatory knowledge that underlies STEM education in one or more of the three broadly conceived Research Areas: Research onSTEM Learning and Learning Environments, Research on Broadening Participation in STEM fields, andResearch on STEM Workforce Development. Within this framework, the ECR program supports a wide range of fundamental STEM education research activities, aimed at learners of all groups and ages in formal and informal settings. Fundamental researchgenerates knowledge and understanding with the potential for broad relevance. The potential implications of ECR fundamental research for improving STEM education practice may be indirect and long-term rather than direct and immediate. Moreover, whether they include basic or use-inspired basic research, all successful ECR:Core proposals focus on the advancement or refinement of foundational knowledge for STEM education. The amount of funding and duration requested in proposals submitted to the ECR:Core solicitation should align with the maturity of the proposed work and the size and scope of the empirical effort. The solicitation has three levels of funding with a range of budget sizes, and proposals may request a duration of 3 to 5 years for any level: (1)Level I proposals may request up to $500,000; (2)Level II proposals may request up to $1,500,000; (3)Level III proposalsmay request up to $2,500,000. All proposals should justify the level of funding and duration in the project description.",

        "description": "The Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) provides awards to federally recognized1 Tribal Colleges and Universities, Alaska Native-serving institutions, and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions to promote high quality science (including sociology, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, economics and bioeconomics, statistics, and other social and behavioral sciences; natural sciences; computer science, including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence, quantum information science, and cybersecurity), technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), STEM education, research, and outreach. Support is available to TCUP-eligible institutions (see the Additional Eligibility subsection of Section IV of this solicitation) for transformative capacity-building or community engagement projects through Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI), Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP),TCUP for Secondary and Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS), TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers), Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI), and Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI). Collaborations led by TCUP institutions that involve non-TCUP institutions of higher education are supported through TCUP Partnerships, with the participation of other NSF programs to support the work of non-TCUP institutions. Finally, research studies that further the scholarly activity of individual faculty members are supported through Small Grants for Research (SGR). Through the opportunities highlighted above, as well as collaborations with other National Science Foundation (NSF) divisions and directorates, and other organizations,TCUPaims toincrease Native individuals&apos; participation in STEM careers, improve the quality of STEM programs atTCUP-eligible institutions, and facilitate the development of a strong STEM enterprise in TCUP institutions&apos; service areas. TCUP supports transformative capacity-building, community engagement, or research projects at TCUP-eligible institutions through the following funding tracks: Instructional Capacity Excellence in TCUP Institutions (ICE-TI) projects provide support to design, implement, and assess comprehensive institutional improvements in STEM education and research capacity at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education. By strengthening STEM education and STEM education research, successful projects will increase the number of STEM students and improve the quality of their preparation. ICE-TI projects create and/or adapt and assess innovative models and materials for teaching and learning in STEM, embody knowledge about how students learn most effectively in STEM teaching and learning activities, and bring STEM disciplinary advances into the undergraduate or graduate experience. The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees offered by TCUP-eligible institutions or significantly enhance instructional approaches. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects (TSIP) support the attainment of a short-term, well-defined goal to improve the quality of STEM education at an eligible institution. Targeted STEM Infusion Projects could, for example, enhance academic infrastructure by systematically adding traditional knowledge to the scope or content of a STEM course, updating curricula, modernizing laboratory research equipment, developing and delivering professional development for K-12 STEM educators, or improving the computational infrastructure.The objective of this strand is to expand STEM degrees or significantly enhance instructional approaches. TCUP for Secondary &amp; Elementary Teachers in STEM (TSETS) supports in-service professional development in STEM disciplinary or STEM education content and/or research for K-12 STEM teachers in the relevant service area. Examples of project activities include, but are not limited to, professional development involving seminar series and engagement in STEM instruction and content during the academic year, structured series of summer intensive workshops and trainings, and summer research opportunities. The objective of this strand is to broaden the instructional capacity for STEM in the K-12 workforce and thereby to the entire community, and to build the capacity for STEM disciplinary or education research among participating educational professionals. TCU Enterprise Advancement Centers (TEA Centers) coalesce the STEM and/or STEM education expertise into a team, designed to support and promote the STEM goals, needs, aspirations, or interests of the chartering reservation or tribe(s). TEA Centers may address a critical tribal or community need or focus on a realm of research or design that is beyond the scope of individual research grants or that is of interest to multiple tribes. The objective of this strand is to build on the capacity developed through prior TCUP support and apply expertise to collaborations with communities in the institution&#8217;s service area, or nationally. The Cyberinfrastructure Health, Assistance, and Improvements (CHAI) strand supports projects at TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education to upgrade the cyberinfrastructure necessary to conduct, expand, manage and administer STEM programs of study, including research. The objective of this strand is to equip TCUP institutions to meet the demands of virtual instruction, advanced computing, and data science opportunities. Preparing for TCUP Implementation (Pre-TI) provides support for activities that prepare an institution for Implementation-level projects.Consequently, they are available only to TCUP-eligible institutions of higher education that have never received TCUP support, have not received TCUP support within the previous five years, or are embarking on a significantly novel STEM strategic plan. Examples of supported activities include completing an institutional assessment of its current STEM instructional capacity, or engaging in conversations necessary to formulate a shared vision of what that capacity should be and how to achieve it. Pre-TI awards can support staff and faculty release time, travel, stakeholder gatherings, and associated administrative costs.The objective of this strand is to conduct self-studies and formulate strategic plans for the development of STEM instructional programs of study. The TCUP Partnerships strand provides support for collaborations that will improve TCUP institutions&apos; instructional and research capacity in STEM fields supported by NSF; attract, retain, and support TCUP students in internships and research endeavors deemed to be necessary for a complete curriculum offering; and engage partner universities to provide an academic grounding and a successful transition for students who wish to study or attain degrees in STEM fields supported by NSF. TCUP Partnerships broaden the number of scientific disciplines available to students at TCUP institution through collaborations with non-TCUP institutions. Active Pre-Engineering Education Collaboratives or Partnerships in Geoscience Education awards are not affected by this revision. The objective of this strand is the development, through instructional and research capacity-building, of academic and career pathways for TCUP students through supporting collaborative projects between and among TCUP and non-TCUP institutions. Interested teams of collaborators for which a TCUP institution serves as lead should contact the TCUP program directors. Support for non-TCUP partners must be obtained from other NSF programs, which follows the procedures of the prior Partnership strands. Small Grants for Research (SGR) strand support STEM or STEM Education faculty members at TCUP-eligible institutions to initiate or pursue research projects or programs that may include undergraduate or graduate student engagement. Awards are intended to help further the faculty member&apos;s research capability and effectiveness; improve research and teaching at his or her home institution and create and study new models and innovations in STEM teaching and learning. International research or collaborations are strongly encouraged. TCUP students may seek support for international research opportunities under the guidance of a TCUP STEM or STEM education faculty member and an international research collaborator. These awards are particularly appropriate as a means of recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientists, engineers, and educators at TCUP-eligible institutions. The objective of this strand is to support faculty research and professional development that build research capacity at TCUP institutions.

        "description": "This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) invites applications for P30 Cancer Center Support Grants (CCSGs) to support NCI-designated Cancer Centers. CCSGs support three types of Cancer Centers: 1) Comprehensive Cancer Centers, which demonstrate reasonable depth and breadth of research activities in each of three major areas: basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, control and population-based research, and which have substantial transdisciplinary research that bridges these scientific areas; and 2) Clinical Cancer Centers, which are primarily focused on basic laboratory; clinical; and prevention, cancer control, and population-based research; or some combination of these areas, and 3) Basic Cancer Centers, which focus on basic laboratory research. The purpose of all types of NCI-designated Cancer Centers is to capitalize on all institutional cancer research capabilities, integrating meritorious research into a single transdisciplinary research enterprise across all institutional boundaries. Cancer Centers supported through this FOA are expected to serve as major sources of discovery of the nature of cancer and of development of more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis, and therapy; to contribute significantly to the development of Shared Resources that support research; to collaborate and coordinate their research efforts with other NCI-funded programs and investigators; and to disseminate research findings for the benefit of the community.",

The funding will be used to support research on improving the occupational safety of workers in the commercial fishing industry. This includes: improving vessel design; developing and improving emergency and survival equipment; enhancing vessel monitoring systems; improving communication devices, de-icing technology, and severe weather detection. In order to support and administer the grant program, the Coast Guard and NIOSH signed a Memorandum of Understanding on May 17, 2018.

NIOSH has an extensive history of conducting research to understand and to reduce hazards in the commercial fishing industry. This research has largely been conducted in close collaboration with crews, industry and the US Coast Guard. To learn more about NIOSH&#8217;s work in commercial fishing safety and health, visit https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/fishing/default.html. Research objectives supported by NIOSH include, but are not limited to, the following: identification and investigation of the relationships between hazardous working conditions and associated occupational injuries and fatalities; development of more sensitive means of evaluating hazards at work sites; development of methods for measuring early markers of injuries and fatalities; development of new protective equipment and engineering control technology to reduce work-related injuries and fatalities; development of work practices that reduce the risks of occupational hazards; and evaluation of the technical feasibility or application of a new or improved occupational safety procedure, method, technique, or system, including assessment of economic and other factors that influence their diffusion and successful adoption in workplaces.

        "description": "CDC seeks to enhance the nation&#8217;s ability to rapidly mobilize, surge, and respond to public health emergencies (PHEs) as identified by CDC by establishing a roster of approved but unfunded (ABU) applicants that may receive rapid funding to respond to PHEs of such magnitude, complexity, or significance that they would have an overwhelming impact upon, and exceed resources available to, the jurisdictions. Applicants will undergo an objective merit review process, and entities that successfully meet the requirements for approval will be placed on the ABU list. CDC will use this ABU list for emergencies that require federal support to effectively respond to, manage, and address identified public health threats. CDC will make funding related to this NOFO available once it has determined a public health emergency exists or is considered imminent and will be contingent upon the availability and stipulations of appropriations. CDC will provide additional guidance and information to those on the ABU list when this NOFO is funded. Since this NOFO is designed to collect applications prior to a PHE, applicants are encouraged to submit work plans and budgets that demonstrate their ability to respond to a PHE. COVID-19 public health response plans, such as plans funded under CDC-RFA-TP18-1802 in 2020 are acceptable for this purpose. If this NOFO is funded for a specific PHE, CDC will develop supplemental guidance that outlines additional work plan and budget requirements tailored to the emergency. This NOFO is not a capacity-building funding mechanism, and it is not intended to create or establish new public health (PH) emergency management programs. It may be used to re- establish capacity lost or diminished because of the public health crisis. It is designed to support the surge needs of existing programs responding to a significant PHE. CDC will provide supplemental guidance to entities on the ABU list when this NOFO is activated regarding specific activities intended to address the emergency. CDC has strong relationships with governmental PH departments, community-based organizations, and other domestic partners and supports them for planning, capacity-building, preparedness, and response to PHEs. This NOFO complements these ongoing capacity-building preparedness and response programs by providing a mechanism for CDC to rapidly mobilize and fund PH organizations for specific response needs. Applicants must describe how this funding will not duplicate or supplant other federal funding. Upon occurrence of a PHE, CDC can rapidly fund specific applicants to accelerate public health crisis response activities such as coordinating emergency operations, hiring surge staff, and conducting needs assessments to determine the resources necessary to address the public health crisis. The NOFO also provides funding for specialized public health emergency response activities tailored to the specific public health crisis.",

The U.S. State Department&#8217; s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) is not accepting applications at this time. Please review the attached notice for full details. Background: The goal of the Program to End Modern Slavery (PEMS) is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking in targeted populations in partner countries and jurisdictions through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships. PEMS-funded efforts conduct scientifically rigorous research to establish evidence on the effects of anti-trafficking programs on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking through the advancement of sound prevalence measurement methodologies, strong monitoring and evaluation practices, evidence-based programming, and the application of victim-centered and trauma-informed approaches. The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 for PEMS, totaling $150 million to date. The TIP Office is interested in funding research and implementation projects focused on five priority areas as they relate to human trafficking: &#8226; Supply Chains &#8226; Climate Change and Displacement &#8226; Public Health &#8226; Financial Inclusion &#8226; Sex Trafficking PEMS encourages the use of partnerships with governments, academia, civil society, the private sector, other funders, and international organizations to advance the goals of the program and improve collaboration on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking. The TIP Office anticipates that a Statement of Interest (SOI) will be released within the next couple of months on SAMS-Domestic and grants.gov followed by a Notification of Funding Opportunity (NOFO).",

Activities pursued by early-career faculty should build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research. NSF encourages submission of CAREER proposals from early-career faculty at all CAREER-eligible organizations and especially encourages women, members of underrepresented minority groups, and persons with disabilities to apply. PECASE:Each year NSF selects nominees for the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) from among the most meritorious recent CAREER awardees.Selection for this award is based on twoimportant criteria:The criteria are 1) performance of innovative research at the frontiers of science, engineering, and technology that is relevant to the mission of the sponsoring organization or agency; and 2) community service demonstrated through scientific leadership, education or community outreach.These awards foster innovative developments in science and technology, increase awareness of careers in science and engineering, give recognition to the scientific missions of the participating agencies, enhance connections between fundamental research and national goals, and highlight the importance of science and technology for the Nation&#8217;s future. Individuals cannot apply for PECASE. These awards are initiated by the participating federal agencies. At NSF, up to twenty-six nominees for this award are selected each year from among the PECASE-eligible CAREER awardees most likely to become the leaders of academic research and education in the twenty-first century. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy makes the final selection and announcement of the awardees.",

        "description": "The MCA program offers an opportunity for scientists and engineers at the mid-career stage (see restrictions under Additional Eligibility Information) to substantively enhance and advance theirresearch program and career trajectory. Mid-career scientists are at a critical career transition stage where they need to advance their research programs to ensure long-term productivity and creativity but are often constrained by service, teaching, or other activities that limit the amount of time devoted to research. The MCA program provides protected time, resources, and the means to gain new skills through synergistic and mutually beneficial partnerships, typically at an institution other than the candidate&apos;s home institution. Partners from outside the Principal Investigator&apos;s (PI) own subdiscipline or discipline are encouraged, but not required, to enhance interdisciplinary networking and convergence across science and engineering fields. Research projects that envision new insights on existing problems or identify new problems made accessible with cutting-edge methodology or expertise from other fields are encouraged. A key component of a successful MCA will be the demonstration that the PI&apos;s currentresearchprogram could substantively benefit from the protected time, mentored partnership(s), and resources provided through this program, such thatthere is a substantial enhancement to the PI&apos;s research and career trajectory, enabling scientific and academic advancementnot likely without this support. The MCA is the only cross-directorate NSF program specifically aimed at providing protected time and resources to established scientists and engineers targeted at the mid-career stage.Participating programs in the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO), Geosciences (GEO), Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Education and Human Resources (EHR) will accept MCA proposals. To help identify the disciplinary program in which the MCA should be reviewed, PIs are urged to investigate the research areas supported by the different directorates and participating programs. PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss the suitability of their MCA proposal with a Program Officer from the appropriate directorate (seehttps://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/mca-mid-career-advancement/announcements/111199).PIs from EPSCoR jurisdictions are especially encouraged to apply.",

For that, data from geological records or other environmental archives are required. The PALEO PERSPECTIVES ON PRESENT AND PROJECTED CLIMATE (P4CLIMATE) competition is a coordinated paleoclimate science initiative that is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Divisions of Atmospheric and GeoSpace Sciences (AGS), Earth Sciences (EAR), Ocean Sciences (OCE), and Office of Polar Programs (OPP) in the Geosciences (GEO) Directorate. The annual P4CLIMATE competition supports the scientific objectives of the National Science Foundation by fostering interdisciplinary research and synthesis of climate data. The goal of the interdisciplinary P4CLIMATE solicitation is to utilize observational and modeling studies to provide paleo perspectives addressing the two research themes:1) Past Regional and Seasonal Climate; and 2) Past Climate Forcing, Sensitivity, and Feedbacks. OPP will accept proposals to this solicitation A) with and without fieldwork in the Arctic, and B) only without fieldwork in the Antarctic. Proposals that have fieldwork in Antarctica should be submitted to the annual solicitation for proposals that have fieldwork in Antarctica.",

        "description": "The Mathematical Biology Program supports research in all areas of mathematical sciences with relevance to the biological sciences. Successful proposals must demonstrate mathematical innovation, biological relevance and significance, and strong integration between mathematics and biology. Some projects of interest to the Mathematical Biology Program may include development of mathematical theories, methodologies, and tools traditionally seen in other disciplinary programs within the Division of Mathematical Sciences. In general, if a proposal is appropriate for review by more than one NSF program, it is advisable to contact the program officers handling each program to determine when and where the proposal should be submitted and to facilitate the review process. The Mathematical Biology Program regularly seeks joint reviews of proposals with programs in the Directorates of Biological Sciences and other relevant programs. Investigators are encouraged to discuss their project with program officers in relevant areas to determine whether it could be considered by more than one program. Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) Investigators submitting an RUI proposal should read the RUI solicitation (link below), as the rules for proposal format may deviate from the Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG). EAGER and RAPID Proposals Prior to submitting proposals for EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) or Rapid Response Research (RAPID), Investigators must contact the cognizant program directors. Requests for Award Supplements Principal Investigatorsare encouraged to contact the cognizant program director prior to submission of a proposal for an award supplement. See the PAPPG for more information. Conferences Investigators should carefully read the program solicitation, &quot;Conferences and Workshops in the Mathematical Sciences,&quot; (link below) to obtain important information regarding the substance of proposals for conferences, workshops, summer/winter schools, and similar activities. To facilitate timely notification of the availability of support: proposals for conferences, workshops, etc., to be held in the US must be submitted 8 months in advance of the conference date; proposals to support group travel to meetings outside the US must be submitted 12 months in advance of the meeting date.

The animal models, related materials, or technological tools developed must be broadly applicable to the scientific interests of two or more NIH Institutes or Centers (ICs) and must evaluate diseases and processes that impact multiple body systems in order to align with the ORIPs NIH-wide mission and programs. Applications must describe the need for and the potential impact of the proposed resources on the research community across a range of scientific disciplines supported by multiple NIH ICs. Applications to develop models that relate strictly to a specific disease or a select area of research or that do not have a broad impact on the NIH-wide research community will not be considered acceptable. Projects that predominantly address the research interests of one NIH IC but are only peripherally related to the research interests of other ICs will also not be acceptable for this funding opportunity announcement (FOA).",

Potential applicants interested in applying to this announcement should click &apos;Subscribe&apos; to be notified of future revisions. DoD HIV/AID Prevention Program&apos;s (DHAPP) objective, through the PEPFAR program, is to save lives, prevent HIV infections, and accelerate progress toward achieving HIV/AIDS epidemic control and to support the development of interventions and programs in military health systems that address these issues. DHAPP works with militaries of foreign countries to devise plans based on the following process:Meet with key partners in country to determine provisional major program areas and other technical assistance needs.Adapt DHAPP support to a country&#8217;s need for prevention, care and/or treatment of its HIV/AIDS situation based on an assessment of the country&#8217;s epidemic, and more specifically, in that country&#8217;s military.Strengthen the military capacity for ownership and behavioral changes over the long term.Consider program design by leveraging assets with other country partners who have/had successful prevention, care, and/or treatment efforts.Focus on prevention, care and/or treatment impact aligned with national implementation plans.Implement and monitor programs to ensure accountability and sustainability.Countries and their militaries need strong evidenced based HIV programs with measurable courses of action that demonstrate the following specific attributes. Priorities for DHAPP include the following but are subject to change.Support and ownership from the military sector.Development of plans of action and support for military policies that further HIV epidemic control.Alignment with PEPFAR and national strategies and priorities.Testing and treatment expansion to meet 2020 goals of 90-90-90 and 2030 goals of 95-95-95 for people living with HIV. (The first goal is identifying 90/95 percent of all HIV-positive individuals in the population; the second goal is linking 90/95 percent of all those identified HIV positive people to consistent antiretroviral treatment; and the last goal is reaching 90/95 percent of all those on antiretroviral treatment to attain viral suppression.)Care and treatment plans should use the &#8220;Treat All&#8221; approach with differentiated models of care including tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis, cervical cancer in HIV positive women, other sexually transmitted infections (STI) other opportunistic infections, and care for those with advanced HIV disease.Reduction of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.Combination prevention using biomedical, behavioral and structural support for sexual transmission of HIV and other STI.Prevention packages for specific populations including a comprehensive package for Key Populations (KP), Priority Populations, and prevention interventions for young people.Stigma and discrimination reduction associated with HIV infection.Program monitoring to collect and report on PEPFAR indicators, ensure quality of service delivery using clinical and laboratory monitoring tools and to take rapid corrective action based on results.Strengthen HIV data collection systems for improved clinical decision making and program management.Promoting sustainability through capacity building of the military partner.Transition to Local Partners: Local partners are encouraged to apply to this announcement.To sustain epidemic control, it is critical that the full range of HIV prevention and treatment services are owned and operated by local institutions, governments, and community-based and community-led organizations &#8211; regardless of current antiretroviral (ARV) coverage levels. The intent of the transitioning to local partners is to increase the delivery of direct HIV services, along with non-direct services provided at the site, and establish sufficient capacity, capability, and durability of these local partners to ensure successful, long-term, local partner engagement and impact.",

        "description": "The USAMRDC&#8217;s mission is to provide solutions to medical problems of importance to the American Service Member at home and abroad, as well as to the general public at large. The scope of this effort and the priorities attached to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian medical science and technology (S&amp;T), operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. Extramural research and development programs play a vital role in the fulfillment of the objectives established by the USAMRDC. General information on the USAMRDC can be obtained at https://mrdc.health.mil/.This BAA is intended to solicit extramural research and development ideas using the authority provided by 10 USC 4001. The BAA is issued under the provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369), as implemented in FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 and in Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs) 22.315. In accordance with FAR 35.016, projects funded under this BAA must be for basic and applied research to support scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on development of a specific system or hardware solution. Research and development funded through this BAA are intended and expected to benefit and inform both military and civilian medical practice and knowledge. This BAA utilizes competitive procedures in accordance with 10 USC 2302(2)(B) for the selection for award of S&amp;T proposals/applications. For the purposes of this BAA, S&amp;T includes activities involving basic research, applied research, advanced technology development, and, under certain conditions, may include activities involving advanced component development and prototypes.The selection process is highly competitive, and the quantity of meaningful submissions (both pre-proposals/pre-applications and full proposals/applications) received typically exceeds the number of awards that available funding can support.This BAA provides a general description of USAMRDC&#8217;s research and development programs, including Research Areas of Interest, evaluation and selection criteria, pre-proposal/ pre-application and full proposal/application preparation instructions, and general administrative information. Specific submission information and additional administrative requirements can be found in the document titled, &#8220;General Submission Instructions,&#8221; which is available on Grants.gov along with this BAA.The FY23-FY27 USAMRDC BAA is continuously open for a 5-year period, from October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2027, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. Submission of a pre-proposal/pre-application is required and must be submitted through the electronic Biomedical Research Application Portal (eBRAP) (https://eBRAP.org/).

        "description": "Synopsis of Program: The fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) hold much promise as sectors of the economy where we can expect to see continuous vigorous growth in the coming decades. STEM job creation is expected to outpace non-STEM job creation significantly, according to the Commerce Department, reflecting the importance of STEM knowledge to the US economy. The National Science Foundation (NSF) plays a leadership role in developing and implementing efforts to enhance and improve STEM education in the United States. Through the NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) initiative, the agency continues to make a substantial commitment to the highest caliber undergraduate STEM education through a Foundation-wide framework of investments. The IUSE: EDU is a core NSF STEM education program that seeks to promote novel, creative, and transformative approaches to generating and using new knowledge about STEM teaching and learning to improve STEM education for undergraduate students. The program is open to application from all institutions of higher education and associated organizations. NSF places high value on educating students to be leaders and innovators in emerging and rapidly changing STEM fields as well as educating a scientifically literate public. In pursuit of this goal, IUSE: EDU supports projects that seek to bring recent advances in STEM knowledge into undergraduate education, that adapt, improve, and incorporate evidence-based practices into STEM teaching and learning, and that lay the groundwork for institutional improvement in STEM education. In addition to innovative work at the frontier of STEM education, this program also encourages replication of research studies at different types of institutions and with different student bodies to produce deeper knowledge about the effectiveness and transferability of findings. IUSE: EDU also seeks to support projects that have high potential for broader societal impacts, including improved diversity of students and instructors participating in STEM education, professional development for instructors to ensure adoption of new and effective pedagogical techniques that meet the changing needs of students, and projects that promote institutional partnerships for collaborative research and development. IUSE: EDU especially welcomes proposals that will pair well with the efforts of NSF INCLUDES (https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/nsfincludes/index.jsp) to develop STEM talent from all sectors and groups in our society. For all the above objectives, the National Science Foundation invests primarily in evidence-based and knowledge-generating approaches to understand and improve STEM learning and learning environments, improve the diversity of STEM students and majors, and prepare STEM majors for the workforce. In addition to contributing to STEM education in the host institution(s), proposals should have the promise of adding more broadly to our understanding of effective teaching and learning practices. The IUSE: EDU program features two tracks: (1) Engaged Student Learning and (2) Institutional and Community Transformation.",

Prior to this announcement, ARL announced two separate BAAs to support the mission: 1) W911NF-17-S-0002 titled &#8220;Army Research Laboratory Army Research Office Broad Agency Announcement for Fundamental Research&#8221;; and 2) W911NF-17-S-0003 titled &#8220;Army Research Laboratory Broad Agency Announcement for Basic and Applied Scientific Research&#8221;. This announcement succeeds BAA W911NF-17-S-0002 and BAA W911NF-17-S-0003 combining the opportunities into a single announcement. ARL&#8217;s mission as the Army&#8217;s foundational research laboratory is to Operationalize Science to ensure overmatch in any future conflict. ARL&#8217;s foundational research mission spans basic research (budget activity 6.1) and applied research (budget activity 6.2) as defined by 32 CFR 22.105 but may include advanced technology development (budget activity 6.3) and advanced component development and prototypes (budget activity 6.4) when opportunities arise to directly or indirectly help achieve ARL&#8217;s mission. ARL partners across the national security enterprise to deliver fundamentally advantageous change that is rooted in the creation and exploitation of scientific knowledge. This publication constitutes a BAA for awards as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016 as well as a merit-based, competitive procedure in accordance with the Department of Defense Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARS) at 32 CFR 22.315(a) and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Other Transaction Guide version 2.0 dated July 2023. This BAA document, and the online list of research topics found on the ARL BAA topics website at https://www.arl.devcom.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/, sets forth ARL&#8217;s research topics of interest for whitepapers and proposals. This BAA is issued under FAR 6.102(d)(2), which provides for the competitive selection of basic and applied research proposals, and 10 U.S.C. 4001, 10 U.S.C. 4021, and 10 U.S.C. 4022, which provide the authorities for issuing awards under this announcement for basic and applied research. The definitions of basic and applied research may be found at 32 CFR 22.105. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provision of Public Law 98-369, &#8220;The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984&#8221; and subsequent amendments.

The goals of this solicitation are to (i) ensure broad adoption of CI tools, methods, and resources by the research community in order to catalyze major research advances and to enhance researchers&#8217; abilities to lead the development of new CI, and (ii) integrate core literacy and discipline-appropriate advanced skills in advanced CI as well as computational and data-driven methods for advancing fundamental research, into the Nation&#8217;s undergraduate and graduate educational curriculum/instructional materials. Proposals responding to this solicitation may target one or both solicitation goals. For the purpose of this solicitation, advanced CI is broadly defined as the set of resources, tools, methods, and services for advanced computation, large-scale data handling and analytics, and networking and security for large-scale systems that collectively enable potentially transformative fundamental S&amp;E research and education. This solicitation calls for innovative, scalable training, education, and curriculum/instructional materials&#8212;targeting one or more of the solicitation goals&#8212;to address emerging needs and unresolved bottlenecks in the S&amp;E research workforce development, from the postsecondary level to active researchers to CI professionals. The funded activities, spanning targeted, multidisciplinary communities, should lead to transformative changes in the state of research workforce preparedness for advanced CI-enabled research in the short- and long-term. This solicitation also seeks to broaden CI access and adoption by (i) increasing the adoption of advanced CI and computational and data-driven methods to a broader range of S&amp;E disciplines and institutions and (ii) effectively utilizing individual capabilities. Proposals from, and in partnership with, the aforementioned communities are especially encouraged. There are two project classes as defined below: Pilot Projects: up to $300,000 total budget with durations up to two years; and Implementation Projects: Small (with total budgets of up to $500,000) or Medium (with total budgets of up to $1,000,000) for durations of up to four years.

        "description": "The Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program (MRI Program Website) serves to increase access to multi-user scientific and engineering instrumentation for research and research training in our Nation&apos;s institutions of higher education and not-for-profit scientific/engineering research organizations. An MRI award supports the acquisition of a multi-user research instrument that is commercially available through direct purchase from a vendor, or for the personnel costs and equipment that are required for the development of an instrument with new capabilities, thereby advancing instrumentation capabilities and enhancing expertise for instrument design and fabrication at academic institutions. MRI instruments are, in general, too costly and/or not appropriate for support through other NSF programs. MRI provides support to acquire critical research instrumentation without which advances in fundamental science and engineering research may not otherwise occur. MRI also provides support to obtain next-generation research instruments by developing instruments with new capabilities that open new opportunities to advance the frontiers in science and engineering research. Additionally, an MRI award is expected to enhance research training of students who will become the next generation of instrument users, designers and builders. An MRI proposal may request from NSF up to $4 million for either acquisition or development of a research instrument. Each performing organization may submit in revised &quot;Tracks&quot; as defined below, with no more than two (2) submissions in Track 1 and no more than one (1) submission in Track 2. For the newly defined Track 3, no more than one (1) submission per competition is permitted. As a result, it is now possible for an institution to submit up to four MRI proposals within the Track limits as described above. Track 1: Track 1 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than $100,000[1] and less than $1,400,000. Track 2: Track 2 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than or equal to $1,400,000 up to and including $4,000,000. Track 3: Track 3 MRI proposals are those that request funds from NSF greater than or equal to $100,000[1] and less than or equal to $4,000,000 that include the purchase, installation, operation, and maintenance of equipment and instrumentation to conserve or reduce the consumption of helium. Institutions may submit no more than one Track 3 proposal. Submission of a Track 3 proposal does not impact limits that apply for Track 1 and Track 2 proposals. Cost sharing requirements for new awards in the MRI Program are waived for a period of 5 years beginning with the FY 2023 MRI competition. Institutional submission limits for Track 1, Track 2 and Track 3 proposals remain. The MRI Program especially seeks broad representation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Proposals from women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities and early-career PIs are encouraged, as are proposals that benefit early-career researchers and proposals with PIs from geographically underserved regions, including EPSCoR jurisdictions. Additionally, proposals are encouraged from under-resourced institutions, including from emerging research institutions, where MRI can significantly build capacity for research. ___________________________ [1]Track 1 proposals requesting funds from NSF less than $100,000 will be accepted only from: a) eligible performing organizations requesting instrumentation supporting research in the disciplines of mathematics or social, behavioral and economic sciences; or b) non-Ph.D.-granting institutions of higher education requesting instrumentation supporting research in any NSF-supported disciplines.",

        "description": " The Social Psychology Program at NSF supports theoretically focused empirical investigations that advance fundamental social psychological explanations of human behavior, attitudes, and experience. Synopsis The Social Psychology Program invites research and infrastructure proposals that advance knowledge of how human behavior is influenced by macro- and micro-level social forces, including how thought, motivation, emotion, neural, and physiological processes explain ways of thinking about and relating to self and others. Proposed research should carry strong potential for groundbreaking discoveries about the power of social dynamics to shape peoples&#8217; attitudes, behavior, and experience. Basic research that connects to emerging and ongoing global challenges is especially encouraged. Proposals that develop new theories or methods are highly encouraged. Proposals involving non-human animals are considered only if the research offers clear and direct contributions to understanding human social behavior. Note: Proposals may be returned without review if the primary goal of the research is to improve clinical practice as its primary outcome, or contains disease-related goals, including work on the etiology, diagnosis or treatment of physical or mental illness or disease, medical abnormality, or clinical interventions. In assessing intellectual merit, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on research that is theoretically grounded, based on empirical observation and validation, and with designs appropriate to the questions asked (including but not limited to experiments, naturalistic observations, field studies, longitudinal analyses, and computational modeling). In assessingbroader impacts, the Social Psychology Program places highest priority on proposals that offer strong potential to benefit society, strengthen national security interests, improve the quality of life, build STEM talent, enhance infrastructure for research and education, increase public engagement with science, and include a proactive plan for sharing the results with a wide variety of audiences. PIs are encouraged to review the NSF resources on broader impact. The Social Psychology Program expects the methods, measures and data that result from NSF support to be openly shared with other researchers and the public. For further guidance proposers should consult Data Management for NSF SBE Directorate Proposals and Awards. The Data Management and Sharing Plan (DMSP) should articulate how the proposed research will engage with best practices of open science. Researchers are expected to engage in open science practices and deviations from that should be well-justified. The Social Psychology Program accepts regular research proposals, including Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) proposals, proposals for research in undergraduate institutions (RUI), rapid response research proposals (RAPID) and early-concept grants for exploratory research (EAGER). The program also accepts small conference proposals for events (including workshops) being planned one year or more after submission. The Social Psychology Program doesnotaccept proposals for doctoral dissertation improvement awards or mid-career advancement (MCA) awards. Principal Investigators should selectPD 22-1332 in the program announcement/solicitation block on the proposal cover sheet for submission of regular research projects to the Social Psychology program. Interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary and convergent research approaches are encouraged, and PIs are encouraged to identify possible other programs for co-review. PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled &#8220;List of Suggested Reviewers&#8221; with their full proposal. Investigators are encouraged to contact a Social Psychology program director before submitting a proposal to confirm its fit with the scope and priorities of the Social Psychology Program. Such contact is most productive when a one-page (maximum) summary of the planned proposal is sent ahead of a meeting. This summary should include a description of the proposed intellectual merit and broader impacts, as well as an additional page of references cited. The Social Psychology program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or related field and have a demonstrated area of basic research expertise relevant to social psychology. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should complete a short survey to indicate their area of expertise and contact information. ",

        "description": "This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), issued by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), invites applications for investigator-initiated Resource-Related Research Projects (R24). The proposed resource must provide a significant benefit to currently funded high priority projects in need of further coordination and support in the areas specified. Under rare circumstances, this mechanism may be used to support development of a new resource to the broader scientific community of the NIAID. It is anticipated that the request for resource support through the R24 activity code will occur on an infrequent basis and only in circumstances where other mechanisms of support from the NIAID are not appropriate. The proposed resources should be relevant to the scientific areas of the NIAID mission including the biology, pathogenesis, and host response to microbes, including HIV; the mechanisms of normal immune function and immune dysfunction resulting in autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, allergy, asthma, and transplant rejection; and translational research to develop vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to prevent and treat infectious, immune-mediated, and allergic diseases.",

        "description": "Oceanographic facilities and equipment are supported by the Integrative Programs Section (IPS) of the Division of Ocean Sciences (OCE), Directorate for Geosciences (GEO). These awards are made for the procurement, conversion and/or upgrade, enhancement, or annual operation of platforms in the ocean, coastal and near-shore waters, and Great Lakes. Awards are generally directed specifically to support facilities that lend themselves to shared use within the broad range of Federally supported research and education programs.Most of these platforms and facilities also receive partial support from other federal agencies, state and local governments, and private sources on a proportional basis usually through a daily rate mechanism. The primary objective of these awards is to ensure the availability of appropriate oceanographic facilities for Federally funded investigators and educators. Individual project-based facilities and instrumentation, limited to one, or a small group of, investigator(s), should be supported through appropriate research programs as opposed to through the IPS programs listed herein. The individual programs covered within this solicitation include: 1. Oceanographic Technical Services (Tech Services) 2. Oceanographic Instrumentation (OI) 3. Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) Oceanographic Technical Service (Tech Services): The Tech Services Program provides support of institutional technical services to enhance the scientific productivity of research programs, aboard research vessels and in shore-based, shared-use facilities. Research vessel technical services include quality assurance, scheduling of technical support, logistical assistance, and at-sea supervision of the instrumentation and shared-use equipment available to sea-going researchers. This program also provides baseline operational support for the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) equipment pools (wire, vans and winches). Support of research vessel technical services and UNOLS equipment pools includes salaries and related expenses, maintenance and calibration of sensors and instrumentation, and associated travel. Oceanographic technical services support requests must be directly attributable to NSF-sponsored science. With the exception of the wire pool, requests for new or replacement capital equipment must be made through the SSSE or OI programs. Oceanographic Instrumentation (OI): The OI Program provides support to enhance the scientific capabilities and productivity of seagoing research projects that utilize research vessels as well as shore-based, shared-use facilities. Proposals may include shared-use instrumentation for the collection, processing, and analysis of oceanographic data. Typical instrumentation includes sensors, acoustic systems, data loggers, water sampling rosettes, biological net systems, coring equipment and auto-analyzers. Proposals must be for instrumentation that will support multiple research projects.OI proposals are generally submitted by the institution&apos;s Tech Services manager whose operational funding is provided through the OCE Technical Services Program. Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE): The SSSE Program provides support to improve safety and enhance scientific capabilities and productivity of seagoing research programs that utilize research vessels as well as shore-based, shared-use facilities.. Proposals may include new permanent or portable equipment required to outfit a vessel to conduct oceanographic research as well as overhaul of equipment previously funded under this program, including science handling systems (winches, frames, cranes, etc.), navigation and communication equipment, and safety and regulatory-related items. Requests for purchase of new winch pool or van pool capital equipment must be submitted to this program. SSSE proposals are generally submitted by the institution&apos;s Marine Superintendent whose operational funding is provided through the Ship Operations Program in OCE.",

Application instructions are found in Section D. Application and Submission Information. Applications will be reviewed and evaluated as they are received and may be submitted at any time up until the closing date of this announcement. The Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Units network is a national consortium of Federal agencies, tribes, academic institutions, state and local governments, nongovernmental conservation organizations, and other partners working together to support informed public trust resource stewardship. The CESU network includes 390 non-Federal partners and 15 Federal Agencies in seventeen (17) CESUs representing biogeographic regions encompassing all 50 states and U.S. territories. The CESU network is well positioned as a platform to support research, technical assistance, education and capacity building that is responsive to long-standing and contemporary science and resource management priorities. The seventeen (17) CESUs bring together scientists, resource managers, students, and other conservation professionals, drawing upon expertise from across the biological, physical, social, cultural, and engineering disciplines (from Anthropology to Zoology) to conduct collaborative and interdisciplinary applied projects that address natural and cultural heritage resource issues at multiple scales and in an ecosystem context. Each CESU is structured as a working collaborative with participation from numerous Federal and non-Federal institutional partners. CESUs are based at host universities and focused on a particular biogeographic region of the country. The NPS is required under &#8220;Research Mandate&#8221; 54 USC 100702 to ensure the management of NPS units are &#8220;enhanced by the availability and utilization of a broad program of the highest quality science and information.&#8221; To help answer this mandate, the NPS works cooperatively with approved CESU cooperators. Annually the NPS obligates between $30M and $40M in CESU cooperative agreements agency wide. Individual projects are up to five (5) years in duration with an average of approximately $60,000 per agreement. The NPS plans to create Master Cooperative Agreements with CESU partners to carry out the CFDA program 15.945, Cooperative Research and Training Programs &#8211; Resources of the National Park System. The NPS is announcing the intent to solicit proposals from organizations within the CESU network. The objectives of the CESU program are: a. Provide usable knowledge to support informed decision making. b. Ensure the independence and objectivity of research. c. Create and maintain effective partnerships among the Federal agencies and universities to share resources and expertise. d. Take full advantage of university resources while benefiting faculty and students. e. Encourage professional development of current and future Federal scientists, resource managers, and environmental leaders. f. Manage Federal resources effectively.",

        "description": "Through this solicitation, NSF seeks to foster a network of S-STEM stakeholders and further develop the infrastructure needed to generate and disseminate new knowledge, successful practices and effective design principles arising from NSF S-STEM projects nationwide. The ultimate vision of the legislation governing the S-STEM parent program[1] (and of the current S-STEM-Net solicitation) is that all Americans, regardless of economic status, should be able to contribute to the American innovation economy if they so desire. To support collaboration within the S-STEM network, NSF will fund several S-STEM Research Hubs (S-STEM-Hub). The S-STEM Network(S-STEM-Net) will collaborate to create synergies and sustain a robust national ecosystem consisting of multi-sector partners supporting domestic low-income STEM students in achieving their career goals, while also ensuring access, inclusion, and adaptability to changing learning needs. The Hubs will investigate evolving barriers to the success of this student population. It will also disseminate the context and circumstances by which interventions and practices that support graduation of domestic low-income students (both undergraduate and graduate) pursuing careers in STEM are successful. The target audience for this dissemination effort is the community of higher education institutions, faculty, scholars, researchers and evaluators, local and regional organizations, industry, and other nonprofit, federal, state, and local agencies concerned with the success of domestic low-income STEM students in the United States.

The DAC is the Army&apos;s foundation for data-driven analytical decisions across the lifecycle to ensure overmatch for a lethal Army. DAC&#8217;s mission is to: Inform Army modernization and readiness decisions with objective Analysis enabled through Tool development and Data curation. DAC partners across the national security enterprise to deliver fundamentally advantageous change that is rooted in the creation and exploitation of scientific knowledge. DAC accomplishes this mission by funding the areas of applied research (budget activity 6.2), as defined by 32 CFR 22.105, advanced technology development (budget activity 6.3), and advanced component development and prototypes (budget activity 6.4). Whitepapers for initial concept reviews and full proposals are sought from institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, foreign organizations, foreign public entities, and for-profit organizations (i.e. large and small businesses) for scientific research that supports the DAC mission. The DAC BAA generally conforms to the portfolio structured around research area based mission execution. Whitepapers and full proposals are expected to be for cutting-edge innovative research that could produce discoveries with a significant impact to enable new and improved Army technologies and related operational capabilities and related technologies. In an effort to provide DAC&apos;s research topics and related information in an easy to digest format, DAC has published the following public website listing all current DAC research topics: https://www.army.mil/article/261533, hereafter referenced as the DAC BAA topics website. DAC focuses on executing in-house research programs but supplements our efforts with support from the broader technology base and Academia. DAC funds a modest amount of extramural research in certain specific areas, and those areas are described on the DAC BAA topics website. Changes to these topics will be made using this website on an as needed basis. A change to the DAC BAA topics website is not an amendment to this BAA and will not be posted on https://www.grants.gov/ and https://sam.gov/. A change to this document, the BAA itself, is an amendment and will be posted on https://www.grants.gov/ and https://sam.gov/. DAC will maintain a daily static snapshot of the DAC BAA topics website to ensure submissions are aligned with listed research topics on the day of submission. Interested parties are encouraged to continually browse the DAC BAA topics website for white paper and proposal topics that DAC desires to explore. These specific research topics should be viewed as suggestive, rather than limiting. DAC is always interested in considering other innovative research concepts of relevance to the Army if those concepts align with DAC&apos;s mission. Please see Section II, Detailed Information about the Funding Opportunity, for more information on the DAC research topics advertised through this BAA. Interested parties should also review https://www.grants.gov/ and https://sam.gov/ to obtain the latest version of the BAA for whitepaper and proposal submission requirements. ",

The Department will take necessary action with the Funding Opportunity Announcement and issue additional guidance including adjusting the close date if appropriate. The U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s (DOL) Veterans&#8217; Employment and Training Service (VETS) supports local Stand Down events that assist veterans experiencing homelessness by providing a wide range of employment, social, and health services.Stand Down is a military term referring to an opportunity to achieve a brief respite from combat. Troops assemble in a base camp to receive new clothing, hot food, support services, and a relative degree of safety before returning to combat action. A DOL VETS-funded Stand Down event serves a similar purpose; however, it is intended for veterans experiencing or at-risk of homelessness. The critical services provided at these events are often the catalyst that enables those individuals to reenter the workforce. VETS awards these noncompetitive grants on a first-come, first-served basis to support one-day or multi-day events at up to $7,000 or $10,000, respectively. They are collaborative events coordinated between VA, DOL, other federal, state, and local government agencies and community-based organizations providing services and supplies to veterans experiencing and at risk of homelessness. In the event of a federal disaster declaration, VETS will accept applications up to $50,000 to conduct Stand Down events in the impacted areas. State, Territory, and Possession, county, city, local, special district, and Native American tribal governments and agencies, non-profit and for-profit entities, state and local workforce boards, institutions of higher education, public and tribal housing authorities and faith-based organizations are eligible to apply.",

        "description": "More than 25 million Americans suffer from daily chronic pain, a highly debilitating medical condition that is complex and difficult to manage. In recent decades, there has been an overreliance in the prescription of opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function and high addiction liability. This contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid overdose deaths and addictions. Innovative scientific solutions to develop alternative pain treatment options are thus critically needed. Through targeted research efforts, the NIH HEAL Initiative aims to support the development of safe and effective devices to treat pain with little or no addiction liability. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is designed to support interdisciplinary research teams of multiple PD/PIs to investigate the mechanism of action of pain relief by medical devices with the overall goal of optimizing therapeutic outcomes for FDA-approved or -cleared technologies. Program teams are expected to accomplish goals that require considerable synergy and collaborative interactions. Teams must leverage appropriate multi-disciplinary expertise to develop new principles and methods for experimentation, analysis, and interpretation. Teams are encouraged to consider objectives that will produce major advances in the field of pain relief by medical devices.",

The U.S. State Department&#8217; s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (TIP Office) is not accepting applications at this time. Please review the attached notice for full details. Background: The goal of PEMS is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking in targeted populations in partner countries and jurisdictions through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships. PEMS-funded efforts conduct scientifically rigorous research to establish evidence on the effects of anti-trafficking programs on the reduction of the prevalence of human trafficking through the advancement of rigorous research methods. This includes sound prevalence measurement; strong monitoring and evaluation practices; evidence-based programming; and the application of survivor-centered and trauma-informed approaches. The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 for PEMS, totaling $200 million to date. The TIP Office is interested in funding projects that utilize Intervention Development Research (IDR) to conduct research and pilot targeted programming to effectively prevent and respond to human trafficking. IDR employs various qualitative and quantitative methodologies to identify the complex systems in which human trafficking occurs, determine modifiable elements of the crime, including risk and protective factors; develop a theory of change; and design and pilot interventions to develop an intervention model that can be scaled-up and/or adapted for other settings. Local partnerships and utilization of methods of co-creation and participatory research are core elements of IDR. Local actors must play an active role in all phases of the project, from planning and development through implementation of the intervention. Please read the full notice attached.",

        "description": "Cyberspace has transformed the daily lives of people. Society&apos;s overwhelming reliance on cyberspace, however, has exposed the system&apos;s fragility and vulnerabilities: corporations, agencies, national infrastructure, and individuals continue to suffer cyber-attacks. Achieving a truly secure cyberspace requires addressing both challenging scientific and engineering problems involving many components of a system, and vulnerabilities that stem from human behaviors and choices. Examining the fundamentals of security and privacy as a multidisciplinary subject can lead to fundamentally new ways to design, build, and operate cyber systems, protect existing infrastructure, and motivate individuals to learn about cybersecurity. The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014, as amended by the National Defense Authorization Acts for 2018 and 2021, and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, authorizes the National Science Foundation (NSF), in coordination with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to offer a scholarship program to recruit and train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals to meet the needs of the cybersecurity mission of federal, state, local, and tribal governments. The goals of the CyberCorps&#174; Scholarship for Service (SFS) program are aligned with the U.S. strategy to develop a superior cybersecurity workforce. The program goals are to: (1) increase the number of qualified and diverse cybersecurity candidates for government cybersecurity positions; (2) improve the national capacity for the education of cybersecurity professionals and research and development workforce; (3) hire, monitor, and retain high-quality CyberCorps&#174; graduates in the cybersecurity mission of the Federal Government; and (4) strengthen partnerships between institutions of higher education and federal, state, local, and tribal governments. While all three agencies work together on all four goals, NSF&#8217;s strength is in the first two goals; OPM&#8217;s in goal (3); and DHS in goal (4). The SFS Program welcomes proposals to establish or to continue scholarship programs in cybersecurity. A proposing institution must provide clearly documented evidence of a strong existing academic program in cybersecurity. In addition to information provided in the proposal narrative, such evidence can include ABET accreditation in cybersecurity; a designation by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security as a Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education(CAE-CDE), in Cyber Operations (CAE-CO) or in Research (CAE-R); or equivalent evidence documenting a strong program in cybersecurity. Service Obligation: All scholarship recipients must work after graduation in the cybersecurity mission of a federal, state, local, or tribal government organization, or certain other qualifying entities, for a period equal to at least the length of the scholarship. The SFS Program also supports efforts leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce cybersecurity professionals. Funding opportunities in this area are provided via the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace - Education Designation (SaTC-EDU) and other programs (see the section &quot;Increasing National Capacity in Cybersecurity Education&quot; for more details.)",

        "description": "1.The Centers of Excellence in Genomic Science (CEGS) program establishes academic Centers for advanced genome research. Each CEGS award supports a multi-investigator, interdisciplinary team to develop integrated, transformative genomic approaches to address a biomedical problem. A CEGS project will address a critical issue in genomic science, genomic medicine, or computational genomics, proposing a highly innovative solution that would be a major advance. The research will entail substantial risk, balanced by outstanding scientific and management plans and very high potential payoff. A CEGS will focus on the development of novel technological or computational methods for the production or analysis of comprehensive data sets, on a genome-scale biomedical problem, or on other ways to develop and use genomic approaches for understanding biological systems or furthering the application of genomic knowledge, data, and methods towards clinical applications. Each CEGS will nurture genomics by facilitating the interaction of investigators from several disciplines. Along with its scientific goals, CEGS will also expand the pool of genomic scientists and engineers that can use and apply the novel methods, concepts, and knowledge developed by the CEGS by providing education and outreach experiences to scientists at all career levels.",

Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, &quot;The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984&quot; and subsequent amendments.ARI is the Army&#8217;s lead agency for the conduct of research, development, and analyses for Army readiness and performance via research advances and applications of the behavioral and social sciences that address personnel, organization, and Soldier and leader development issues. Programs funded under this BAA include basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development that can improve human performance and Army readiness.Funding of research and development (R&amp;D) within ARI areas of interest will be determined by funding constraints and priorities set during each budget cycle. Those contemplating submission of a proposal are encouraged to contact the ARI Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) identified in Section G of this BAA or the responsible ARI Manager noted at the end of the technical area entry (Part II Section A of this BAA) to determine whether the proposed R&amp;D warrants further inquiry. If the proposed R&amp;D warrants further inquiry and funding is available, submission of a white paper or proposal will be entertained. The recommended three-step sequence is (1) initial contact with the ARI TPOC or responsible ARI Manager, (2) white paper submission, (3) proposal submission.This sequence allows earliest determination of the potential for funding and minimizes the labor and cost associated with submission of proposals that have minimal probability of being selected for funding. Costs associated with white paper or proposal submissions in response to this BAA are not considered allowable direct charges to any resulting award. These costs may be allowable expenses to normal bid and proposal indirect costs specified in FAR 31.205-18.Applicants submitting proposals are cautioned that only a Government Contracting or Grants Officer may obligate the Government to any agreement involving expenditure of Government funds.To be eligible for an award under this announcement, a prospective awardee must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources and responsibility, ability to comply with the performance schedule, past performance, integrity, experience, technical capabilities, operational controls, and facilities. In accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policies, no person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving financial assistance from the Army.",

        "description": "The National Science Foundation (NSF) plays a prominent role in the improvement of undergraduate STEM education at the Nation&#8217;s colleges and universities. Through the IUSE: Innovation in Two-Year College STEM Education (ITYC) program, the agency seeks to extend this effort by making an intentional investment in the country&#8217;s two-year institutions of higher education, or two-year colleges. The twin goals of the ITYC program are to (1) center students in the effort to advance innovation and promote success in STEM education at two-year colleges, and (2) enhance the capacity of two-year colleges to harness the talent and potential of their student and faculty populations through innovative disciplinary, multi-department, and college-wide efforts. These goals will be achieved by investing in projects at two-year colleges that contribute to student success in STEM-based foundational courses and academic pathways for both majors and non-majors. Project activities may be in any discipline that is currently supported by NSF funding, which includes the social, behavioral, and economic sciences. Collectively, projects in the ITYC program will make progress towards ensuring that two-year college students and faculty have the resources to participate in and contribute to the broader STEM enterprise. Aligned with the goals above, the ITYC program features two tracks: (1) A Focus on the Academic Experiences of Two-Year College Students and (2) Leveraging Two-Year College Strengths and Innovation. Each Track can support projects requesting up to $500,000 for a duration of up to three years. For institutions that have not received NSF funding in the past five years, an additional $100,000 may be added to the budget which may be used by the institution to support and carry out grant-funded activities over four years. This would result in a total maximum budget of $600,000 for a project over four years. Institutions that have been funded as part of a collaborative award with their own NSF Award Number are not eligible for this incentive, however, institutions that have had a subaward from another institution are eligible. This program is open to two-year colleges, which includes the following institutions, as described by Carnegie Classifications: Associate&#8217;s Colleges: Institutions at which the highest-level degree awarded is an associate degree. This may include transfer as well a career and technical oriented colleges. Baccalaureate / Associate&#8217;s Colleges: Institutions that award at least one baccalaureate degree but confer at least 50% of their degrees at the associate level. The ITYC program is aligned with NSF&apos;s Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) framework, which is a comprehensive effort to accelerate improvements in the quality and effectiveness of undergraduate education in STEM fields.",

        "description": "The Decision, Risk and Management Sciences Program (DRMS) supports scientific research directed at increasing understanding and effectiveness of decision making by individuals, groups, organizations and society. DRMS supports research with solid foundations in theories and methods of the social and behavioral sciences. This social and behavioral science research should advance knowledge, address fundamental scientific and societal issues and have strong broader impacts. DRMS funds disciplinary and interdisciplinary research, doctoral dissertation research improvement grants (DDRIGs) and conferences in the following areas: judgment and decision making; decision analysis and decision aids; risk analysis, perception and communication; societal and public-policy decision making; management science and organizational design. The program supports the use of the RAPID funding mechanism for research that involves ephemeral data, typically tied to disasters or other unanticipated events. Much less frequently, the program also supports highly unusual, proof-of-concept, high-risk projects that are potentially transformational (Early Concept Grants for Exploratory Research &#8211; EAGER). For detailed information concerning RAPID and EAGER grants, please review Chapter II.E of theNSF PAPPG. All research must be grounded in theory and generalizable. Purely algorithmic management-science proposals should be submitted to theOperations Engineering (OE)Program rather than to DRMS. Decision, Risk and Management Sciences offers Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIGs) to improve the quality of dissertation research.For detailed guidelines on preparing a DDRIG proposal, consult the separateDRMS-DDRIG solicitation.",

This program also strengthens both empirical and theoretical economic analysis as well as the methods for rigorous research on economic behavior. It supports research in almost every area of economics, including econometrics, economic history, environmental economics, finance, industrial organization, international economics, labor economics, macroeconomics, mathematical economics, and public finance. The Economics program welcomes proposals for individual or multi-investigator research projects, doctoral dissertation improvement awards, conferences, symposia, experimental research, data collection and dissemination, computer equipment and other instrumentation, and research experience for undergraduates. The program places a high priority on interdisciplinary research. Investigators are encouraged to submit proposals of joint interest to the Economics Program and other NSF programs and NSF initiative areas. The program places a high priority on broadening participation and encourages proposals from groups and regions that traditionally have not participated fully in science, mathematics, and engineering. The program also funds conferences and interdisciplinary research that strengthens links among economics and the other social and behavioral sciences as well as mathematics and statistics. The Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIG) funding opportunity is designed to improve the quality of dissertation research.DDRIG proposals are submitted by a faculty member on behalf of the graduate student. DDRIG awards provide funds for items not normally available through the student&apos;s university such as enabling doctoral students to undertake significant data-gathering projects and to conduct field research in settings away from their campus. DDRIGs do not provide cost-of-living or other stipends or tuition.Outstanding DDRIG proposals specify how the knowledge to be created advances economics science. Proposals for Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants (DDRIGS) in Economics should follow the directions for submissions in the PAPPG. Please contact an Economics program officer if you plan to submit a DDRIG proposal. For additional funding opportunities, we invite you to also look at theSBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities web site.",

HNDS research will identify ways in which dynamic, distributed, or heterogeneous data can provide novel answers to fundamental questions about individual or group behavior. HNDS is especially interested in proposals that provide data-rich insights about human networks to support improved health, prosperity, and security. HNDS has two tracks: (1) Human Networks and Data Science &#8211; Infrastructure (HNDS-I). Infrastructure proposals will address the development of data resources and relevant analytic techniques that support fundamental Social, Behavioral and Economic (SBE) research. Successful infrastructure proposals will construct, within the financial resources provided by the award, databases or relevant analytic techniques and produce a finished product that will enable previously impossible data-intensive research in the social sciences. The databases or techniques should have significant impacts, either across multiple fields or within broad disciplinary areas, by making possible new types of data-intensive research in the SBE sciences. (2) Human Networks and Data Science &#8211; Core Research (HNDS-R). Core research proposals will advance theory in a core SBE discipline by the application of data and network science methods. This includes the leveraging of large data sets with diverse spatio-temporal scales of measurement and linked qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as multi-scale, multi-level network data and techniques of network analysis. Supported projects are expected to yield results that will enhance, expand, and transform theory and methods, and that generate novel understandings of human behavior &#8211; particularly understandings that can lead to significant societal benefits or opportunities. HNDS-R encourages core research proposals that make innovative use of NSF-supported data networks, databases, centers and other forms of scientific infrastructure including those developed by HNDS-I (formerly RIDIR) projects.",

        "description": "CREST Center awards provide support to enhance the research capabilities of Minority-serving institutions (MSIs) through the establishment of centers that effectively integrate education and research. CREST Center awards promote the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty, and an expanded presence of students historically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Successful CREST Center proposals will demonstrate a clear vision and integration of STEM research and education and will align with the mission of the Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM (EES) with respect to the development of a diverse STEM workforce. CREST Centers are also expected to provide leadership by meaningfully involving the efforts of those faculty, students, and postdoctoral researchers who are traditionally underrepresented in STEM at all levels. Centers are required to use evidence-based and innovative strategies to address salient broadening participation and workforce development issues, such as recruitment, retention, and mentorship of participants from underrepresented groups. Successful proposals are expected to achieve national research competitiveness, broaden participation in STEM, and generate sustained, non-CREST funding from federal, state, and/or private-sector sources. PhaseI and Phase II CREST Center Awards Preliminary proposals are required for Phase I and Phase II projects. Thus, an invitation from NSF must be received before submitting a full proposal. Both Phase I and Phase II CREST Center awards provide multi-year support for institutions that demonstrate a strong research base. Phase I CREST Center awards provide funding for five years of research on a specific NSF-supported topic. If invited, institutions may submit a Phase II CREST Center proposal requesting funding to continue research in the same disciplinary area as the Phase I Center or may submit a Phase I proposal focused on a disciplinary area that is significantly different from those of the previous award(s). CREST Partnership Supplements CREST Partnership Supplemental funding requests are invited from current CREST Center awardees. Supplements support the establishment or strengthening of partnerships and collaborations with active CREST Centers and other nationally or internationally recognized research centers (including NSF-supported research centers), private sector research laboratories, K-12 schools, and/or informal science entities, including museums and science centers, as appropriate. Such partnerships and collaborations should aid CREST Centers&#8217; quest in advancing knowledge and education on a research theme of national significance.",

Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are most closely related to humans, both physiologically and genetically. Therefore, NHPs are critical animal models for basic and translational research aimed at understanding human biology, both in normal and diseased states. Proper husbandry and management of NHPs require specialized physical and intellectual resources, which are most effectively and economically provided in centralized primate centers, the resources of which are made available to investigators on a national basis. The NPRCs provide these resources to investigators/grantees who utilize NHPs in biomedical research and thereby complement and help enable the missions of the NIH Institutes and Centers.",

        "description": "The goal of the Discovery Research PreK-12 program (DRK-12) is to catalyze research and development that enhances all preK-12 teachers&#8217; and students&#8217; opportunities to engage in high-quality learning experiences related to the sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The program&#8217;s objectives are to: (1) build knowledge about how to develop preK-12 students&#8217; and teachers&#8217; STEM content knowledge, practices, and skills; (2) support collaborative partnerships among STEM education researchers, STEM education practitioners and school leaders with the goals of extending relevant scientific literatures while developing more effective practice; and (3) build the field of STEM education by supporting knowledge synthesis, interdisciplinary interactions across fields and stakeholders, and the development of novel and robust ways of assessing teacher and student learning, engagement, and skills. Outcomes of DRK-12 projects can include but are not limited to promising, evidence-based products that can be used by others to support the success of all teachers and all students (e.g., curriculum, teaching and research tools, and models of collaboration). The program solicits proposals along two strands: (1) Learning and (2) Teaching. While these strands certainly overlap and have synergy, proposals should identify one strand that is most consistent with the proposal&#8217;s objectives and research questions (e.g., are the project&#8217;s methods and outcomes focused primarily on teacher development and teaching or student development and learning?). Research project types under both Strands include exploratory, design and development, impact, implementation, measurement and assessment, and synthesis studies. The program also supports other project types including Partnership Development Grants and Workshops/Conferences. Successful proposals demonstrate how they build on fundamental research in STEM education and on previous or current applied research and development efforts. They also explain their theoretical and empirical justification (e.g., Why is the project designed as it is?) and outline related specific aims and methods with potential to yield new understandings of STEM teaching and learning contexts, processes, and outcomes. The program welcomes proposals focused on teaching and learning in any STEM field(s) and on priorities identified in the National Science Foundation&#8217;s strategic plan. Efforts focused on facilitating the reciprocal exchange or mobilization of knowledge between the research and preK-12 formal education professional communities are strongly encouraged (see this Dear Colleague Letter https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23078/nsf23078.jsp).",

This NOFO is intended to expand and strengthen the community of clinician investigators engaged in vision research. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) allows the appointment of Scholars proposing to serve as the lead investigator of an independent clinical trial; or proposing a separate ancillary clinical trial; or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial led by another investigator as part of their research and career development program. For this career development program scholars are limited to clinical trials that are minimal risk. The existing clinical trial must be a NIH-defined clinical trial that fulfills the NIH requirement for minimal risk trial. A minimal risk trial is one in which the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.

Research and mentorship must be in the field of HIV/AIDS translational studies, using nonhuman primates (NHPs) as preclinical models. These awards will provide 3 years of support for intensive research career development under the guidance of an experienced mentorship team, with expertise in both the pre-clinical application of NHP HIV/AIDS models and in translation of the results from such studies to clinical application in humans. The expectation is that this sustained experience will launch independent research careers and enable awardees to become competitive for new research project grant (e.g., R01) funding. This funding initiative addresses research priorities of the fiscal year (FY) 2021-2025 NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-Related Research (https://www.oar.nih.gov/hiv-policy-and-research/strategic-plan): reduce the incidence of HIV; develop next-generation HIV therapies; research toward HIV cure; and address HIV-associated comorbidities, coinfections, and complications. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is designed specifically for candidates proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. Applicants to this FOA are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor.

REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects specifically designed for the REU program. This solicitation features two mechanisms for supporting student research: REU Sites are based on independent proposals to initiate and conduct projects that engage a number of students in research. REU Sites may be based in a single discipline or academic department or may offer interdisciplinary or multi-department research opportunities with a coherent intellectual theme. REU Supplements may be included as a component of proposals for new or renewal NSF grants or cooperative agreements or may be requested for ongoing NSF-funded research projects. REU projects with an international dimension are welcome. Undergraduate student participants in either REU Sites or REU Supplements must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals,or U.S. permanent residents. Students do not apply to NSF to participate in REU activities, and NSF does not select students for the opportunities. Investigators who receive REU awards establish their own process for receiving and reviewing applications and selecting students, and students follow the instructions provided by each REU Site or REU Supplement to apply. (In some cases, investigators pre-select students for REU Supplements.) To identify appropriate REU Sites, students should consult the directory of active REU Sites on the Web at https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/reu_search.cfm.",

The NOFO aims to facilitate the transition of previously or currently funded SBIR and STTR Phase II and Phase IIB projects to the commercialization stage by providing additional support for technical assistance and later stage research and development (R and D) not typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts. This may include independent replication of key studies, Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, clinical studies, manufacturing costs, regulatory assistance, or a combination of services. Although a significant amount of the work in a CRP award may be subcontracted to other institutions, the Small Business Concern (SBC) is expected to maintain oversight and management of the R and D throughout the award.This Notice of Funding Opportunity requires that at least 1 clinical trial be proposed. The proposed project must be related to the programmatic interests of one or more of the participating NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) based on their scientific missions.",

        "description": "The Universe is the ultimate laboratory, and we can now probe it as never before through several powerful and diverse windows &#8211; electromagnetic waves, high-energy particles, and gravitational waves. Each of these windows provides a different view. Together they reveal a detailed picture of the Universe that will allow us to study matter, energy, and the cosmos in fundamentally new ways. The &#8220;Windows on the Universe&#8221; Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (WoU-MMA) program identifies three categories of messengers - electromagnetic waves, high-energy particles including neutrinos and cosmic rays, and gravitational waves. The goals of WoU-MMA are to build the capabilities and accelerate the synergy between observations and theory to realize integrated, multi-messenger astrophysical explorations of the Universe. The WoU-MMA program welcomes proposals in any area of research supported through the participating divisions that address at least one of the following criteria: Coordination: Activities to coordinate observations involving more than one messenger. Observations: Observations of astrophysical objects or phenomena that are potentially sources of more than one messenger. Interpretation: Theory, experiment, simulations and other activities to understand or interpret observations of astrophysical objects that are sources of more than onemessenger. Competitive proposals will accelerate the progress in multi-messenger astrophysics and advance the community activities that have been developed during the initial five-year period of the WoU-MMA program. These build on observational and analysis capabilities at the intersection of the explorations enabled by each of the three windows. Efforts to integrate research communities to develop full interoperability between the three windows, and to develop a skilled new workforce in this field, are also encouraged. Proposals should be submitted to the relevant programs listed below (see Related Programs). The WoU-MMA program is not intended to replace existing programs that make awards that involve experimental or theoretical efforts related to each of the three messengers. Rather, the WoU-MMA program is meant to fund awards that have significant components of multi-messenger astrophysics. Priority will be given to proposals for dedicated efforts that significantly advance the WoU-MMA goals. A proposal that is requesting consideration within the context of WoU-MMA should begin the title with the identifying acronym &quot;WoU-MMA:&quot;. PIs should ask for consideration and review as a WoU-MMA proposal only if the proposal addresses at least one of the criteria listed above. Proposals marked for consideration by the WoU-MMA program that do not address at least one of these criteria will be reviewed solely within the participating program(s) to which they were submitted. Supplement requests to existing awards within a program that address one of the above criteria will also be considered.",

        "description": "Proposals in the area of plasma physics submitted to the Division of Physics that are not governed by another solicitation (such as CAREER), should be submitted to the Division-wide solicitation: Division of Physics: Investigator-Initiated Research Projects. The Plasma Physics program participates in multiple NSF meta-programs such as the ECosytem for Leading Innovation in Plasma Science and Engineering (ECLIPSE), Windows on the Universe: The Era of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (WoU-MMA), and Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&amp;E). Topically appropriate proposals may also be submitted to the Plasma Physics program in response to NSF Dear Colleague Letters such as Critical Aspects of Sustainability (CAS): Innovative Solutions to Sustainable Chemistry (CAS-SC). When permitted under an MOU between NSF and another funding agency or private foundation, NSF may share information from proposals submitted to this solicitation for consideration of joint funding, and may invite employees of such organizations to attend merit review panels as observers. MOUs of relevance to the Plasma Physics program presently exist with the Department of Energy/Office of Science, National Nuclear Security Administration, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation, the Czech Science Foundation, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), and the Swiss National Science Foundation. Plasma Physics is a study of matter and physical systems whose intrinsic properties are governed by collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles. 99.9% of the visible Universe is thought to consist of plasmas. The underlying physics of the collective behavior in plasmas has applications to space physics and astrophysics, materials science, applied mathematics, fusion science, accelerator science, and many branches of engineering. The Plasma Physics program supports research that can be categorized by several broad, sometimes overlapping, sub-areas of the discipline, including: magnetized plasmas in the laboratory, space, and astrophysical environments; high energy density plasmas; low temperature plasmas; dusty, ultra-cold, and otherwise strongly coupled plasmas; non-neutral plasmas; and intense field-matter interaction in plasmas. The focus of the Plasma Physics program is to generate an understanding of the fundamental principles governing the physical behavior of a plasma via collective interactions of large ensembles of free charged particles, as well as to improve the basic understanding of the plasma state as needed for other areas of science and engineering. Principal Investigators (PIs) are encouraged to consider including specific efforts to increase diversity of the plasma physics community and broaden participation of under-represented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as Broader Impacts of proposed work. Development of new undergraduate and graduate plasma physics curricula, or curricula enhancement to include plasma physics topics in other courses, at institutions lacking such coursework is similarly encouraged. NSF recognizes that some research projects within this Program may require more than three years to realize demonstrable research outcomes. For such projects, PIs are encouraged to consult the above Program Director to discuss the possibility of submitting a proposal of 4- or 5-year duration. Some Plasma Physics-related activities are supported primarily by other NSF Programs. Proposals focused on the physical properties of individual or a small number of atoms or molecules, or optical physics, should be directed to the Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics Program within the Division of Physics. Proposals focused on understanding astrophysical systems should be directed to the Division of Astronomical Sciences. Proposals focused on understanding the Geospace environment or the Sun-Earth interactions should be directed to an appropriate program within the Geospace Section of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences. Proposals focused on development of new materials using plasmas should be directed to an appropriate program in the Division of Materials Research. Proposals focused on plasma-assisted manufacturing should be directed to the Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation. Finally, proposals focused on use of plasmas for environmental and reaction engineering, environmental sustainability, combustion systems, or engineering of biomedical systems should be directed to an appropriate program within the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport systems.",

        "description": "The contemporary research landscape is a collaborative and international enterprise requiring high level coordination among multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural teams. As such, the Accelerating Research through International Network-to-Network Collaborations program (AccelNet) values cooperation over competition. Program goals are to 1) leverage prior NSF support for building research capacity towards activities that launch international research network of networks (NoN) that will lead to an accelerated advancement of an area of science after the award period and 2) recruit and foster a diverse and internationally competent US-based workforce trained in conducting and leading multi-team international collaboration. Any area funded by the National Science Foundation is eligible, particularly those addressing grand research challenges identified within research communities and/or by NSF. Successful proposals will demonstrate that the proposed activities will: 1) accelerate scientific research at a rate that would not be possible without concerted international cooperation in research planning; 2) make NoN members more competitive for research awards following the period of award; 3) recruit and foster a US-based diverse and internationally competent workforce trained in conducting and leading multi-team international collaboration. Proposals must include detailed plans for collaborative networking activities that will result in a synergy of effort across the entire NoN. The AccelNet Program has two tracks. The Design Track allows PIs to build on prior research by providing time and resources for building capacity across teams to launch a synergistic international NoN. The Implementation Track allows PIs to build on prior research or networking activities by providing time and resources to implement an international NoN. There are two phases to the Implementation Track. Phase 1 funding is for activities related exclusively to NoN activities and is open to all PIs, including but not limited to prior successful Design Track PIs. Phase 2 funding is for early concept research arising from Phase 1 activities and is only open to Phase 1 PIs who have identified a critical research gap during synergistic networking activities in the first 18-24 months of Phase 1 awards.",

The program will fund P50 SPORE grants to support state-of-the-art investigator-initiated translational research that will contribute to improved prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of an organ-specific cancer or a highly related group of cancers. For the purpose of this FOA, a group of highly related cancers are those that are derived from the same organ system, such as gastrointestinal, neuroendocrine, head and neck, and other cancers. Other programmatically appropriate groups of cancers may include those centered around a common biological mechanism critical for promoting tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression in organ sites that belong to different organ systems. For example, a SPORE may focus on cancers caused by the same infectious agent or cancers promoted and sustained by dysregulation of a common signaling pathway. In addition, a SPORE may focus on cross-cutting themes such as pediatric cancers or cancer health disparities. The research supported through this program must be translational and must stem from research on human biology using cellular, molecular, structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches. SPORE projects must have the goal of reaching a translational human endpoint within the project period of the grant.",

RITELsupports future-oriented exploratory and synergistic research in emerging technologies (including, but not limited to, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and immersive or augmenting technologies) for teaching and learning. The program accepts proposals that focus on learning, teaching, or a combination of both. The scope of the program is broad and includes teaching and learning in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and in foundational areas that enable STEM (e.g., self-regulation, literacy, communication, collaboration, creativity, and socio-emotional skills). RITEL supports research in all learning contexts (e.g., formal, informal, workplace) and for all learner populations. RITEL has a special interest in learner/educator populations and in developing new educational technologies that are cost-effective for budget-limited school districts, colleges and universities.Research in this program should be informed by the convergence (synthesis) of multiple disciplines: e.g., learning sciences; discipline-based education research; computer and information science and engineering; design; and cognitive, behavioral, and social sciences.RITEL is unique in its requirement that projects must advance research inbothlearning (and/or teaching) and technology.",

        "description": "The Cognitive Neuroscience (CogNeuro) program seeks to fund proposals that can advance our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior. Funded proposals typically relate precise and rich quantifications of physiological responses and behavior in ways that advance theory (Intellectual Merit). Funded proposal also typically strengthen the field through, for example, outreach, mentoring the next generation of diverse cognitive neuroscientists, and/or increasing awareness and utilization of the research the field produces (Broader Impacts). Intellectual Merit In general, successful proposals provide a theoretical motivation and consist of a series of experiments/analyses that test the differential predictions of that theory; they go beyond quantifying physiology during certain tasks and behaviors. Research topics considered for funding include but are not limited to: perception, recognition, categorization, implicit and explicit memory, working memory, attention, language, decision-making, and social reasoning. Commensurate with the inherently multidisciplinary nature of the field and the limitations of any single technique, a wide variety of physiological methods are considered, including but not limited to: neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI, EEG, MEG), non-invasive stimulation (e.g. TMS, tDCS), lesion analysis, intracranial recording, optogenetics, genetics, optical imaging, computational modeling, and pharmacological interventions in both human and non-human primates and other animal models. The program is particularly interested in proposals that achieve or enable convergence across multiple techniques. Critically, proposals will be returned without review if they are focused on: 1) either behavior or physiology and lack a specific link between them, 2) understanding clinical populations, 3) non-human animals without a clear benefit to our understanding of humans. Broader Impacts In general, successful proposals make impacts beyond traditional academic routes, such as publishing research or teaching undergraduate courses. Strong broader impacts can be quite varied but will typically involve specific efforts strengthening the field and/or increasing its visibility that leverage the characteristics of the institution, department, and/or researcher. Consider the following non-exhaustive examples: 1) STEM education and outreach, particularly in underserved communities, 2) directly involving undergraduates and high-school students in research, 3) making tools and applications for the general public, 4) science journalism or advocacy. These efforts can, but need not, directly relate to the proposed research. It is also encouraged to include budget for these efforts if warranted. Mentoring Plans Strong mentoring plans generally go beyond inclusion in standard lab activities and incorporate specific ideas for forwarding the careers of young scientists and trainees that leverage the setting and content of the proposed research. General Directions Prior to the development of a full proposal, investigators are strongly encouraged to submit a one-page summary of the proposed research to a program director to evaluate its appropriateness for the CogNeuro program. Please contact the director early enough to allow for revisions and incorporation what may be extensive feedback. The summary should include an overview of your research and statements of intellectual merit and broader impacts, the two NSF review criteria. See the Merit Review Fact Sheet for more important facts about the NSF merit review process. Please read the NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG) carefully, as it will be strictly adhered to even if other directives or communications appear to contradict it. Currently, the average standard/CAREER award size is $175,000-$225,000 per year for 3-5 years. Awards in excess of $1.0 million are exceptionally rare and almost always multidisciplinary. Please be judicious in your requests, understanding the realities of the limited funding available for all proposals. See the Listing of Active Cognitive Neuroscience Awards for additional award information. Declined proposals are ineligible for resubmission until a minimum of one year has passed since the due date of their initial submission, unless specifically allowed by the PO in the feedback received during the decline process. This moratorium allows investigators the time required to digest the results of the merit review and revise their proposal accordingly. A proposal that has not been substantially revised will be returned without review as per the PAPPG. PIs are strongly encouraged to submit the Single Copy Document titled &#8220;List of Suggested Reviewers&#8221; with their full proposal. Sharing of data and other materials is an expectation for funded research. Please consult the NSF Dear Colleague Letter: Effective Practices for Data for more details. Interested in talking with a program director? Send a one-page description of the proposed research to sbe-cogneuro@nsf.gov.",

TWSC aligns to the 2022 Plan&#8217;s Goal Statement: &#8220;NASA&#8217;s enduring purpose is scientific discovery and exploration for the benefit of the United States and all of humanity. NASA seeks to discover the secrets of the universe, search for life elsewhere, and protect and improve life on Earth and in space. Finding answers to these profound science questions requires support for national priorities in science and exploration, enhancing new opportunities for cross-disciplinary science, and expanding the societal benefits of our science programs.&#8221; TWSC award sizes will vary from amounts in the low thousands of dollars&#8212;for example to cover travel and registration to a third-party&#8217;s event &#8212; to $750,000 or more for a large event. TWSC welcomes proposals for large and small meetings, retreats, seminars, symposiums, workshops, or other events, including asynchronous and virtual workshops, etc. The purpose of TWSC events may be 1) to disseminate technical information beyond NASA and SMD; or 2) to facilitate research networks and/or research administration capabilities at entities not previously funded by NASA. Participation is open to U.S. organizations or institutions, including minority serving educational and not-for-profit institutions, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. See the NOFO&#8217;s Section 3, for detailed eligibility information. TWSC has no dedicated funding, so proposers are directed to first contact a NASA division, office, or program that may have funding before preparing a proposal. For more details about how to identify and contact possible funders in SMD see Section 7.1. TWSC does not accept Notices of Intent (NOI). Instead, potential proposers must prepare an &#8220;Inquiry Email&#8221; as described in the NOFO&#8217;s Section 4.2.1, and receive an email response from an SMD Program Officer(s), TWSC point of contact, or Division Director prior to submitting a full proposal. TWSC primarily awards grants made under the authority of 2 CFR 200. When NASA and other federal civil servants or employees of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) propose to TWSC, the event that they proposed may be subject to limitations described in Sections 4.14, &quot;Within NASA, Inter-Agency and NASA-as Primary Sponsor Awards&quot;, and 2.6.1, &#8220;Non-Assistance Proposals and Awards and Assistance Awards that Propose Work or Activities by NASA or JPL or Other Federal Entities&#8221;. TWSC is authorized by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, P.L. 111-314 and National Space Program 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2451-2484 (1976) P.L. 85-568. All interested parties must read the NOFO carefully. All proposals to TWSC must comply with the requirements, constraints, and guidelines contained within the NOFO. Any costs incurred in preparing submissions in response to this email or to the full NOFO are incurred completely at the submitter&apos;s own risk.

        "description": "Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to accelerate the adoption and validation of molecular/cellular/imaging markers (referred to as &quot;markers&quot; or &quot;biomarkers&quot;) and assays for cancer detection, diagnosis, prognosis, monitoring, and prediction of response or resistance to treatment, as well as markers for cancer prevention and control. This NOFO will also support the validation of pharmacodynamic markers and markers of toxicity. Applicants to this NOFO must have an assay(s) whose performance has been analytically validated in specimens similar to those for the intended clinical use of the marker(s) and assay(s). As chemotherapies and/or radiation therapies are increasingly combined with immunotherapies to enhance the durability of anti-cancer responses, assays for measuring multiple markers, including immune markers, can be developed and validated simultaneously.The UH3 mechanism will support the clinical validation of established assays for up to 3 years using specimens from retrospective or prospective clinical trials or studies. This NOFO may be used to validate existing assays for use in other trials, observational studies, or population studies. Efforts to harmonize clinical laboratory tests, including investigation into the performance and reproducibility of assays across multiple clinical laboratories, are also appropriate for this funding opportunity. Projects proposed for this NOFO will require multi-disciplinary interaction and collaboration among scientific investigators, oncologists, statisticians, and clinical laboratory scientists. This NOFO is not intended to support early-stage development of technology or the conduct of clinical trials but is intended for validation of assays to the point where they could be integrated into clinical trials/studies as investigational assays.",

The Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network (BPN) encourages applications from small businesses seeking support to advance their small molecule drug discovery and development projects into the clinic. Participants in the BPN are responsible for conducting all studies that involve disease- or target-specific assays, models, and other research tools and receive funding for all activities to be conducted in their own laboratories. In addition, applicants will collaborate with NIH-funded consultants and can augment their project with NIH contract research organizations (CROs) that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis including under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and Phase I clinical testing. Projects can enter either at the Discovery stage, to optimize promising hit compounds through medicinal chemistry to the Development stage, to advance a single development candidate through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing. Alternatively, projects can enter at the Development stage and progress in a shorter period to IND enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing. Projects that enter at the Discovery stage and meet their milestones may continue on through Development. BPN awardee institutions retain their assignment of IP rights and gain assignment of IP rights from the BPN contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for drug candidates developed in this program.",

        "description": "The International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) program supports international research and research-related activities for U.S. science and engineering students. The IRES program contributes to development of a diverse, globally engaged workforce with world-class skills. IRES focuses on active research participation by undergraduate and/or graduate students in high quality international research, education and professional development experiences in NSF-funded research areas. The overarching, long-term goals of the IRES program are to enhance U.S. leadership in science and engineering research and education and to strengthen economic competitiveness through training the next generation of science research leaders. IRES focuses on the development of a world-class U.S. STEM workforce through international research experiences for cohorts of U.S. students. Student participants supported by IRES funds must be citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of the United States. Students do not apply directly to NSF to participate in IRES activities. Students apply to NSF-funded investigators who receive IRES awards. To identify appropriate IRES projects, students should consult the directory of active IRES awards. All PIs, co-PIs and Senior Personnel on IRES proposals must be from U.S. based organizations. Personnel from international partners should be listed as &quot;non-NSF funded collaborators.&quot; Guidance on information to provide for &quot;non-NSF funded collaborators&quot; is found in Section V.A. IRES projects engage a group of undergraduate and/or graduate students in active high-quality collaborative research, in principle at an international site with mentorship from international researchers. IRES projects must be organized around a coherent overarching intellectual theme that may involve a single discipline or multiple disciplines funded by NSF. For all IRES proposals, PIs are strongly encouraged to outline a variety of virtual, hybrid or other alternative approaches to strengthen and maintain international collaboration in addition to travel. It is expected that these approaches will extend collaboration beyond the actual international trip and strengthen IRES proposals overall. ",

Agency Overview:[BM1] The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260) to: &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The FOA and any awards made under this FOA are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on and the development of transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive down the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. By contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly lower than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development. The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221; (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy (http://fossil.energy.gov/), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (http://energy.gov/oe/office-electricity-delivery-and-energy-reliability). Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;) should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees.

Program Overview This announcement is purposely broad in scope to encourage the submission of the most innovative ideas in energy technology to support transformative energy R&amp;D that complements ARPA-E&#8217;s primary mechanism, which is through the solicitation of research projects in focused technology programs.ARPA-E&#8217;s focused programs target specific areas of technology that the agency has identified through extensive interaction with the appropriate external stakeholders. The focused programs have significant potential impact on one or more of the statutory goals described in Section I.A of the FOA. Awards made in response to the solicitation for focused programs support the aggressive technical targets established in that solicitation. Taken in total, ARPA-E&#8217;s focused programs cover a broad swath of energy technologies and applications. However, ARPA-E wants to ensure that there are opportunities to support innovative energy R&amp;D in new and emerging fields that either fall outside of the focused technology programs or that develop after those programs have closed. Within this general framework, ARPA-E seeks transformative ideas that enable the most efficient, economical, sustainable, and environmentally benign utilization of energy. Useful energy can take many forms, including radiant energy from lights, electrical energy for appliances, thermal energy to heat homes, mechanical energy for transportation, chemical energy in the form of food, and energy used to manufacture products.

This FOA requires a minimum of three interrelated research projects that investigate a complex biomedical theme or research question. The projects may be supported by core units, if justified, to facilitate economy of effort, space, and equipment. The NHLBI provides support for Program Project Grants (PPGs) in the belief that collaborative research efforts can accelerate the acquisition of knowledge more effectively than a simple aggregate of research projects that have no interaction or thematic integration. NHLBI is particularly interested in encouraging new scientific directions in PPGs. Use of the P01 activity code is viewed as an opportunity to attract scientists who have not traditionally been supported by the NHLBI. Further, the PPG environment presents an opportunity for emerging scientific leaders to gain insight into how to lead a successful scientific Program, and applicants will have the opportunity to include a project led by an Early Stage Investigator (ESI). All projects in the Program must be interrelated and have objectives that address a central theme within the scientific mandate of the NHLBI.",

The research experiences will prepare clinicians to successfully compete for individual NIH mentored career development awards, or where appropriate, independent research awards. This FOA will also support educational activities such that participants of the R25 are expected to attend and participate in an annual workshop specific to this FOA to present their work, discuss progress and plans towards transitioning to the next career stage and to network with other researchers and leaders in their fields. Such success will facilitate their transition from resident/fellow to physician-scientist, and will thus foster retention of a cadre of physician-scientists who will conduct research into the mechanisms of, etiology, and treatment of neurological diseases.",

Research is sought that is conducted in real-world settings, where a wide range of clinical presentations, psychosocial factors, age-related (e.g., youth; adult; older adult), geographic (rural/remote settings), cultural considerations, and health disparities influence the types of care that are provided. Studies are encouraged that address the continuum of crisis service systems, as well as applications that address crisis services for children and under-resourced populations.",

Congress appropriated funding starting in fiscal year 2023 for EPA to establish and implement a grant program to assist Tribal entities in Alaska with addressing contamination on ANCSA lands that were contaminated prior to the time of conveyance. Grants may be used for site assessment and remediation, as well as related community outreach and involvement. Eligible entities include Alaska Native regional and village corporations, federally recognized Tribes in Alaska, Alaska Native nonprofit associations, and inter-tribal consortia comprised of Alaskan tribal entities. Proposals will be accepted on a rolling basis. As long as funds remain available, EPA expects to extend the closing date for this funding opportunity. Before submitting a proposal, please contact Contaminated ANCSA Assistance Program project managers to indicate interest. Details on how to apply are provided in the Contaminated ANCSA Lands Assistance Program Guidance.",

        "description": "Plasma science is a transdisciplinary field of research where fundamental studies in many disciplines, including plasma physics, plasma chemistry, materials science, and space science, come together to advance knowledge for discovery and technological innovation. The primary goal of the ECosystem forLeadingInnovation inPlasmaScience andEngineering (ECLIPSE) program is to identify and capitalize on opportunities for bringing fundamental plasma science investigations to bear on problems of societal and technological need within the scope of science and engineering supported by the participating NSF programs. The ECLIPSE meta-program has been created to foster an inclusive community of scientists and engineers, an ecosystem spanning multiple NSF Directorates, in the pursuit of translational research at the interface of fundamental plasma science and technological innovation. The ECLIPSE program builds on the long history of NSF leadership in supporting multi-disciplinary research in plasma science and engineering, and is intended to enhance organizational unity within NSF, and potentially with other funding agencies, in considering proposals and supporting projects that may otherwise struggle to find a natural home within the existing hierarchy of Directorates, Divisions, and programs within the Foundation. Examples of topical areas within the scope of the ECLIPSE program include but are not limited to: Plasma surface interactions, with applications to, e.g., advanced manufacturing, materials processing, and catalysis. Atmospheric pressure plasmas and microplasmas with applications to, e.g., microelectronics, plasma agriculture, environmental remediation, and other clean and decarbonized energy goals enabled by electrification of the chemical industry. Dusty plasmas with applications to, e.g., development of nanomaterials, aerosols, and functionalized surface coatings. Novel sensor development for highly non-equilibrium plasmas with applications to, e.g., cubesat-based geospace measurements and industrial plasma diagnostics. Novel computational modeling for multi-component and/or multi-phase plasma systems with applications to, e.g., space weather prediction and plasma reactor design. Novel studies of plasmons in nano-photonics and nano-optics with applications to, e.g., sub-THz wireless communication and photocatalytic chemical processes. New chemical measurement science for characterizing processes occurring in plasmas and using plasmas as part of measurement systems with applications to, e.g., analysis of environmental contaminants or identification of forensic evidence. Study of fundamental chemical reactions and mechanisms in plasmas with applications to, e.g., novel chemical synthesis. Proposals submitted for consideration by this program should address societal or technological needs within the scope of science and engineering supported by the National Science Foundation. Proposals addressing technology development primarily supported by other US government funding agencies are not eligible for consideration and may be returned without review. Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact the cognizant Program Officers if they are unsure of the suitability of a project to this program. Proposals submitted for consideration by the ECLIPSE program should satisfy the following criteria: (1) clearly articulate the fundamental scientific and/or engineering challenge in plasma science and engineering that may be relevant to more than one NSF program; and (2) provide a substantive discussion of how a resolution of the stated scientific and/or engineering challenge will address specific societal and/or technological needs identified as priorities by the research communities, policymakers and/or other stakeholders. Depending on the nature of the proposal, the latter may be described as the Intellectual Merit or the Broader Impact of the proposed activity. The program encourages inclusion of specific efforts to increase the diversity of the ECLIPSE community and to broaden participation of under-represented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) as Broader Impacts of proposed work. The program welcomes proposals from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), and institutions in EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions, along with collaborations between these institutions. Proposers are also encouraged to address how the proposed efforts may enhance workforce development towards STEM careers associated with the field of plasma science and engineering. The ECLIPSE program is not intended to replace existing programs. A proposal that is requesting consideration within the context of ECLIPSE should begin the title with the identifying acronym &quot;ECLIPSE:&quot; and should be submitted to one of the &quot;Related Programs&quot; listed below. In choosing the most relevant program, proposers are advised to read program descriptions and solicitations carefully and to consult with cognizant Program Officers in advance of proposal preparation. Proposal submissions outside of the scientific scope of the receiving program may be transferred to a different program or may be returned without review. Proposers should ask for consideration and review as an ECLIPSE proposal only if the proposal addresses both of the criteria listed above. Proposals marked for consideration by the ECLIPSE program that do not address both of these criteria may be returned without review or reviewed within the context of an individual program. Supplement requests to existing awards within a program that address both of the above criteria may also be considered. Information Sharing with other Funding Agencies When permitted under an MOU between NSF and another funding agency, NSF may share information from proposals for consideration of joint funding and may invite employees of such organizations to attend merit review panels as observers.",

        "description": "The goal of Future Manufacturing is to support fundamental research, education, and training of a future workforce to overcome scientific, technological, educational, economic, and social barriers in order to catalyze new manufacturing capabilities that do not exist today. Future Manufacturing seeks inventive approaches to invigorate the manufacturing ecosystem and seed nascent future industries that can only be imagined today. Future Manufacturing supports research and education that will enhance U.S. leadership in manufacturing by providing new capabilities for companies and entrepreneurs, by improving our health, quality of life, and national security, by expanding job opportunities to a diverse STEM workforce, and by reducing adverse impacts of manufacturing on the environment. At the same time, Future Manufacturing enables new manufacturing that will address urgent social challenges arising from climate change, global pandemics and health disparities, social and economic divides, infrastructure deficits of marginalized populations and communities, and environmental sustainability. Future Manufacturing will complement existing efforts, supported by NSF and other federal agencies, in advanced manufacturing, but the focus of this program is to enable new, potentially transformative, manufacturing capabilities rather than to improve current manufacturing. Proposals that are incremental improvements over existing advanced manufacturing technologies will not be competitive. The 2022 National Strategy for Advanced Manufacturing (NSAM) shows how advances in U.S. manufacturing enable the economy to continuously grow as new technologies and innovations increase productivity, enable next-generation products, support our capability to address the climate crisis, and create new, high-quality, and higher-paying jobs. It highlights the need to enhance environmental sustainability and address climate change through objectives that include decarbonization of processes and sustainable manufacturing and recycling. The CHIPS and Science Actsupports research and education in semiconductor and microelectronics manufacturing and in other areas ranging from additive manufacturing to artificial intelligence. The recent Executive Order on Advancing Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing Innovation for a Sustainable, Safe, and Secure American Bioeconomy aims to expand domestic biomanufacturing capacity for products spanning the health, energy, agriculture, and industrial sectors. Manufacturing in the future will rely on computation to ensure the reliable translation of product designs to manufacturing plans; process controls to assure those plans produce products that meet specifications; new materials, chemicals, devices, processes, machines, and design and work methods; systems that encompass people, processes, equipment, materials, and information within a production environment; and new social structures and business practices. Fundamental research to overcome significant barriers will be required in quantum and semiconductor devices and integrated systems, robotics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, sustainable chemistry and production, materials science, education and public policy, and workforce development. Three thrust areas have been identified for support under this solicitation: Future Cyber Manufacturing Research, Future Eco Manufacturing Research, and Future Biomanufacturing Research. This solicitation seeks proposals to perform fundamental research to enable new manufacturing capabilities in one or more of these thrust areas. This solicitation will support the following two award tracks: Future Manufacturing Research Grants (FMRG) - up to $3,000,000 for up to four years; and Future Manufacturing Seed Grants (FMSG) - up to $500,000 for up to two years. Proposals should take a convergence approachthat involves cross-disciplinary partnerships among engineers, scientists, mathematicians, social and behavioral scientists, STEM education researchers, and experts in arts and humanities. Team sizes should be commensurate with the scope of the plans for science, technology, innovation, and education and workforce development. Proposals that include significant participation from minority-serving institutions, primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges, institutions from EPSCoR states, and/or incorporate expertise in improving diversity and inclusion are especially encouraged. The goal of this solicitation is to enable new manufacturing that represents a significant change from current practice. Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include within the Project Description a section titled Enabling Future Manufacturing. Please see &quot;Proposal Preparation Instructions&quot; for additional details. Realization of the benefits of the fundamental research supported under this solicitation will require the simultaneous education of a skilled technical workforce that can transition new discoveries into U.S. manufacturing companies. The National Science Board emphasizes this perspective in its report, &quot;THE SKILLED TECHNICAL WORKFORCE: Crafting America&apos;s Science and Engineering Enterprise.&quot; Therefore, proposers responding to this solicitation must include a plan to equip students and upskill the workforce to enable Future Manufacturing. Please see &quot;Proposal Preparation Instructions&quot; for additional details. The results of Future Manufacturing could change how workers interact with technology. Investigators may choose to address challenges in this area by including an optional component of research which focuses on future workers and their interactions with the new technology. Please see &quot;Proposal Preparation Instructions&quot; for specifics. FURTHER INFORMATION: Informational webinars will be held on February 2, 2024 from 1:00-2:00 PM EST and February 28, 2025 from 1:00-2:00 PM to discuss the Future Manufacturing program and answer questions about this solicitation.

        "description": "Convergence research is a means for solving vexing research problems, in particular, complex problems focusing on societal needs or deep scientific challenges. It entails integrating knowledge, methods, and expertise from different disciplines and developing novel paradigms that catalyze scientific discovery and innovation. GCR identifiesConvergence Researchas having two primary characteristics: Research driven by a specific and compelling problem.Convergence research is generally inspired by the need to address a specific challenge or opportunity, whether it arises from deep scientific questions or pressing societal needs. Deep integration across disciplines.As experts from different disciplines pursue common research challenges, their knowledge, theories, methods, data, research communities andlanguages become increasingly intermingled or integrated. New frameworks, paradigms or even disciplines can form sustained interactions across multiple communities. A distinct characteristic of convergence research, in contrast to other forms of multidisciplinary research, is that from the inception, the convergence paradigmintentionallybrings together intellectually diverse researchers and stakeholders to frame the research questions, adopt common frameworks for addressing them, and create and implement innovative scientific approaches for their solution. This includes, when appropriate, developing new integrated theories, methods, research tools, and ways of communicating across disciplines and sectors.Research teams practicing convergence aim to develop sustainable collaborations that may not only create solutions to the specific problem studied, but also develop novel ways of investigating related research questions and open new research vistas. This GCR solicitation targets multidisciplinary teams who are embracing convergence research as a means of developing highly innovative solutions to complex research problems. GCR proposals are expected to be bold and address scientific or technical challenges and bottlenecks which if resolved have the potential to transform scientific understanding and solve vexing problems. Successful GCR projects are anticipated to lead to paradigm shifting approaches within disciplines, establishment of new scientific communities, or development of transformative technologies that have the potential for broad scientific or societal impact. The aim of GCR is to cultivate and grow the earliest foundations of convergent approaches for addressing a specific and compelling problem. As such, proposals submitted to this solicitation are expected to explore novel avenues not previously investigated that are at the forefront of advancing science through deep integration. Proposers must make a convincing case that the research to be conducted is within NSF&#8217;s purview, integrates across NSF directorate or division boundaries, and is currently not supported by other NSF programs or solicitations. The proposers must outline a five-year research plan delineated in two phases, Phase I: years 1-2, and Phase II: years 3-5.The total budget for Phase I may not exceed $1,200,000, and the total for Phase II may not exceed $2,400,000. Successful proposals will be funded initially for two years. Each team&#8217;s progress will be evaluated at a reverse site visit near the end of year 2; this will involve preparing a progress report and making a team presentation to a panel of reviewers/site visitors. Only teams that show exceptional progress according to the merit review and solicitation specific criteria during the first two years and that articulate plans for furthering advancements at the forefront of convergence research will be eligible for additional funding for up to three years pending availability of funds.",

Breeding colonies are essential to sustain appropriate SPF macaques for research related to HIV/AIDS. Pedigree SPF macaques are free of certain viruses, which may confound the results of HIV/AIDS-related investigations or present a risk to the personnel who care for the animals. The SPF macaques are genetically characterized for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I types, because MHC class I genotypes have large effects on macaque immune responses to Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) that can induce AIDS in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and on human immune responses to HIV.",

        "description": "The Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research is designed to fulfill the mandate of the National Science Foundation (NSF) to promote scientific progress nationwide. NSF EPSCoR facilitates the establishment of partnerships among academic institutions, government, industry, and non-profit sectors that are designed to promote sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction&apos;s research infrastructure, Research and Development (R&amp;D) capacity, and R&amp;D competitiveness of EPSCoR-eligible jurisdictions (i.e., states, territories, and commonwealths). Eligibility to participate in the EPSCoR funding opportunities, including the EPSCoR RII: EPSCoR Research Fellows program, is described on theNSF EPSCoR website. EPSCoR RII: EPSCoR Research Fellows directly aligns with the NSF EPSCoR strategic goal of establishing sustainable Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) professional development pathways that advance workforce development and effects engagement in STEM at national and global levels. EPSCoR RII: EPSCoR Research Fellows provides awards to build researchcapacityin institutions and transform the career trajectories of investigators and further develop their individual research potential through collaborations with investigators from the nation&#8217;s premier private, governmental, or academic research institutions and/or centers. The fellowship provides opportunities to establish strong collaborations through extended or periodic collaborative visits to a selected host site.Through collaborative research activities with the host site, Fellows will be able to learn new techniques, develop new collaborations, advance existing partnerships, benefit from access to unique equipment and facilities, and/or shift their research toward potentially transformative new directions. The experiences gained through the fellowships are intended to have lasting impacts that will enhance the Fellows&#8217; research trajectories well beyond the award period. The benefits to the Fellows are also expected to improve the research capacity of their institutions and jurisdictions more broadly. EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII): EPSCoR Research Fellows offers the following two tracks: 1)EPSCoR Research Fellows: NSF; and 2) EPSCoR Research Fellows: @NASA&#8239; While the two tracks have similar goals, EPSCoR Research Fellows: NSF is open to a broad community and EPSCoR Research Fellows: @NASA supports faculty from eligible institutions (See Section&quot;IV. Eligibility Information&quot; for more details) to collaborate with researchers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) research centers. PIs who are eligible for both tracks may apply for only one track per competition cycle. Proposals from both tracks are submitted to and merit reviewed by NSF. Awards in the EPSCoR Research Fellows: @NASA track are referred to NASA EPSCoR for distribution of additional NASA funds and other needed NASA coordination required for the award. In both tracks, the EPSCoR RII: EPSCoR Research Fellows program provides opportunities for the participation of one trainee, who must be an undergraduate or graduate student enrolled full-time in an accredited degree program, or a postdoctoral researcher from an EPSCoR jurisdiction. Staff members, such as technicians or lab assistants could be considered as trainees when properly justified.",

        "description": "Developmental Sciences supports basic research that increases our understanding of perceptual, cognitive, linguistic, social, cultural, and biological processes related to human development across the lifespan. Research supported by this program will add to our knowledge of the underlying developmental processes that support social, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, thereby illuminating ways for individuals to live productive lives as members of society. The Developmental Sciences program supports research that addresses developmental processes within the domains of perceptual, cognitive, social, emotional, language, and motor development across the lifespan by working with any appropriate populations for the topics of interest including infants, children, adolescents, adults (including aging populations), and non-human animals. The program also supports research investigating factors that affect developmental change, including family, peers, school, community, culture, media, physical, genetic, and epigenetic influences. The program funds research that incorporates multidisciplinary, multi-method, and/or longitudinal approaches; develops new methods, models, and theories for studying development; and integrates different processes (e.g., memory, emotion, perception, cognition), levels of analysis (e.g., behavioral, social, neural) and time scales. The program funds basic research that advances our understanding of developmental processes and mechanisms; the program does not fund clinical trials and research focused primarily on health outcomes. The budgets and durations of supported projects vary widely and are greatly influenced by the nature of the project. Investigators should focus on innovative, potentially transformative research plans and then develop a budget to support those activities, rather than starting with a budget number and working up to that value. While there are no specific rules about budget limitations, a typical project funded through the Developmental Sciences program is approximately three years in duration with a total cost budget, including both direct and indirect costs, between $100,000 and $200,000 per year. Interested proposers are urged to explore the NSF awards database for the Developmental Sciences program to review examples of awards that have been made. Proposals that contain budgets significantly beyond this range may be returned without review. The Developmental Sciences program also considers proposals for workshops and small conferences on a case-by-case basis. These typically have total cost budgets, including direct and indirect costs, of approximately $35,000. Conference proposals may only be submitted following an invitation from the Program Directors. In addition to consulting the NSF awards database, it is often useful for interested proposers to submit (via email) a summary of no more than one page so that a program director can advise the investigator on the fit of the project for DS before the preparation of a full proposal. New investigators are encouraged to solicit assistance in the preparation of their project proposals via consultation with senior researchers in their area, pre-submission review by colleagues, and attendance at symposia and events at professional conferences geared towards educating investigators seeking federal funding. The Developmental Sciences Program is always interested in identifying new reviewers. Potential reviewers should have a Ph.D. in psychology or a related field and have a demonstrated area of expertise relevant to developmental science. Individuals interested in reviewing for the program should complete an expression of interest form. SBE/BCS welcomes the submission of proposals to this funding opportunity that include the participation of the full spectrum of diverse talent in STEM,e.g., as PI, co-PI, senior/key personnel, postdoctoral scholars, graduate or undergraduate students, or trainees. This includes historically under-represented or underserved populations, diverse institutions including Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and two-year colleges, as well as major research institutions. Proposals from EPSCoR jurisdictions are especially encouraged.",

Increase the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of students pursuing associate&#8217;s or baccalaureate degrees in STEM at HSIs. Meeting these goals requiresinstitutions to understand and embrace their students&#8217;strengths, challenges, and lived experiences. While this can happen in many ways and across many parts of an institution, theHispanic Serving Institutions: Enriching Learning, Programs, and Student Experiences (HSI:ELPSE)solicitationis specifically focused on studying and improving the student experience in the following settings: STEM courses, particularly for students pursuing STEM degrees; Certificate, minor, and/or degreeprograms; Academic departments or divisions; and Schools and colleges that represent a partof the entire institution (e.g., a School of Engineering or a College of Natural Sciences). Institutions are encouraged to consider how their mission and designation as anHSI could reimagine and/or strengthen courses, degree programs, departments, or divisions. The HSI:ELPSE solicitation welcomes projects that look to implement, test and refine promising practices and/or conduct research related to broadening participation or improving recruitment, retention, graduation and other positive outcomes for undergraduates in STEM. The HSI:ELPSEsolicitation supportsprojects that are purposefully designed to meet students where they are, accounting for both their assets and the challenges they may face. Identities and experiences are not determined solely by membership in a single monolithic population of students (e.g., Hispanic, first-generation, commuter, etc.). Consequently, institutions are expected to use institutional datato identify equity gaps, identify areas of need,and unpack the factors that shape students&#8217; individual realities and shared experiences. Perspectives gained from these data should be central to the design of the project. This solicitation includes the following tracks: Implementation and Evaluation Projects (IEP): Levels 1 and 2 Educational Instrumentation (EI) Please see below for specific information about each track. Generally, proposals to theIEP track will center on one or more of the following: courses; curricular improvements; pedagogy; support structures inside and outside of the classroom; degree programs; and student pathways. The HSI:ELPSE solicitation will also consider proposals designed to increase access to computing resources and/or laboratory instrumentation needed to provide high-quality undergraduate STEM education at the following types of institutions: (1) HSIs in EPSCoR jurisdictions; and (2) HSI Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) in all other (non-EPSCoR) jurisdictions.Please see the discussion of the Educational Instrumentation Track below for specific details.

Mathematical reasoning is a central ability of human intelligence that plays an important role in knowledge discovery. In the last decades, both the mathematics and computer science communities have contributed to research in machine-assisted mathematical reasoning, encompassing conjecture, proof, and verification. This has been in the form of both formal methods and interactive theorem provers, as well as using techniques from artificial intelligence. Recent technological advances have led to a surge of interest in machine-assisted mathematical reasoning from the mathematical sciences, formal methods, and AI communities. In turn, advances in this field have potential impact on research in AI.",

        "description": "The objectives for the use of cooperative agriculture in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) are: production or modification of specific cover types or growing methods that meet the life history requirements of species for which we have established objectives (e.g., waterfowl production); production of foods for wildlife species for which we have established objectives; and/or maintenance, rehabilitation, or reestablishment of natural habitat. Cooperative agriculture is when a person or entity conducts agricultural practices on NWRS lands in support of the Service&#8217;s conservation and resource management objectives and there is substantial involvement between the Service and that person or entity. The NWRS uses cooperative agreements, known as Cooperative Agriculture Agreements (CAAs), as the legal instruments to formalize the agreement between the Service and the program participant. The cost-sharing of a person or entity in cooperative agricultural on NWRS lands can vary depending on the needs and objectives of the particular NWRS land. For example, the Service may provide the cooperator with the right to perform agricultural practices on NWRS land and a percentage of any resulting crop yield, as well as the ability to use Service water, equipment, and/or refuge staff. In exchange, the cooperator may provide the Service with labor, equipment, and materials; a percentage of any resulting crop yield; and/or maintenance, rehabilitation, or reestablishment of specific habitat conditions on NWRS lands. In addition to or instead of cost-sharing, the Service may accept bids for payment for the person or entity&#8217;s agriculture use (e.g. haying or grazing) on NWRS lands in compliance with the Refuge Revenue Sharing Act. This is a nonfinancial assistance program. No Federal funds are obligated or awarded to program participants. Because a CAA is not a financial assistance award, it is not subject to the regulations at 2 CFR 200 or policy in parts 515 and 516 of the Fish and Wildlife Service Manual.",

Similarly, the senior year has seen notable change through capstone design experiences, which ask students to synthesize the technical knowledge, skills, and abilities they have gained with professional capacities, using reflective judgment to make decisions and communicate these effectively. However, this ideal of the senior year has not yet been fully realized, because many of the competencies required in capstone design, or required of professional engineers, are only partially introduced in the first year and not carried forward with significant emphasis through the sophomore and junior years. The Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and STEM Education (EDU) are funding projects as part of the RED program, in alignment with the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) framework and Professional Formation of Engineers (PFE) initiative. These projects are designing revolutionary new approaches to engineering education, ranging from changing the canon of engineering to fundamentally altering the way courses are structured to creating new departmental structures and educational collaborations with industry. A common thread across these projects is a focus on organizational and cultural change within the departments, involving students, faculty, staff, and industry in rethinking what it means to provide an engineering program. In order to continue to catalyze revolutionary approaches, while expanding the reach of those that have proved efficacious in particular contexts, the RED program supports four tracks: RED Planning (Track 1), RED Adaptation and Implementation (Track 2), RED Innovation (Track 3), and RED Innovation Partnerships (Track 4). Two- and four-year institutions are encouraged to submit to any track as appropriate for their goals and context. RED Planning (Track 1) projects will support capacity-building activities at institutions of special interest to NSF&#8217;s mission, specifically two-year engineering-centered programs building transfer partnerships, two-year or four-year institutions in EPSCoR jurisdictions, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)seeking to level the number of degrees acrossof the full spectrum of diverse talent in engineering. Planning projects should provide the support for such institutions to explore the development of a RED Projects in Tracks 2, 3, &amp; 4. RED Adaptation and Implementation (Track 2) projects will adapt and implement evidence-based organizational change strategies and actions to the local context, which helps propagate this transformation of undergraduate engineering education. RED Innovation (Track 3) projects will develop new, revolutionary approaches and change strategies that enable the transformation of undergraduate engineering education. RED Innovation Partnerships (Track 4) projects will achieve the same goals as Track 3 projects across multiple institutions. Of particular interest to this track are projects partnering two-year institutions with other eligible institutions. Projects in tracks 2, 3, &amp; 4 will include consideration of the cultural, organizational, structural, and pedagogical changes needed to transform one or more departments to ones in which students are engaged, develop their technical and professional skills, and establish identities as professional engineers or technologists. The focus of projects in these tracks should be on the department&#8217;s disciplinary courses and program. RED project initiatives are expected to be institutionalized at the end of the funding period. Proposals are especially encouraged that address areas of increased national interest including but not limited to advanced manufacturing, advanced wireless, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, microelectronics and semiconductors, net zero technologies, sustainability, systems engineering, and quantum engineering.",

        "description": "Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) aims to facilitate the career development and transition of investigators new to entrepreneurship with an interest in small business by simultaneously supporting their entrepreneurial development and the conduct of research and development under their direction. This NOFO supports small business concerns (SBCs) in employing and developing researchers as entrepreneurial Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs). In addition to augmenting scientific research staff and supporting research and development efforts at SBCs, a major component of this NOFO is entrepreneurial training, mentoring, and career development of the PD/PI. Optimal PDs/PIs for this award are scientists and professionals with strong research, technology development, and/or healthcare delivery skills and experience, but limited entrepreneurial and independent research project leadership experience. PDs/PIs are expected to grow their entrepreneurial skillset while working in a small business to develop promising technologies and products that align with NIH&apos;s mission to improve health and save lives.",

        "description": "The purpose of the NHLBI Outstanding Investigator Award (OIA) is to promote scientific productivity and innovation by providing long-term support and increased flexibility to experienced Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PDs/PIs) who are currently PDs/PIs on at least two NHLBI R01-equivalent awards and whose outstanding record of research demonstrates their ability to make major contributions to heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) research. The OIA is intended to support a research program, rather than a research project, by providing the primary and most likely sole source of NHLBI funding on individual grant awards. The OIA will support the research program of NHLBI-funded investigators for up to seven years. The OIA will provide investigators increased freedom to conduct research that breaks new ground or extends previous discoveries in new directions. It will also allow PDs/PIs to take greater risks and to pursue research that requires a longer timeframe. Research supported by the OIA must be within the scope of the NHLBI mission (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/mission-statement). It is anticipated that the OIA will: Provide a stable funding environment, thereby improving productivity and facilitating nimble, ambitious, creative research; Accelerate scientific innovation by enabling flexibility in pursuing new research directions as they arise, since PDs/PIs will not be bound to specific aims proposed in advance of the studies; Reduce the time researchers spend writing grant applications and managing multiple grant awards, thereby allowing more time to be devoted to conducting research; Facilitate commitment of PDs/PIs to research through increased stability of funding; and Enable PDs/PIs to devote more time and energy to mentoring students and junior scientists and providing scientific service.",

The K02 award provides three to five years of salary support and &quot;protected time&quot; for newly independent scientists who can demonstrate the need for a period of intensive research focus as a means of enhancing their research careers. Each independent scientist career award program must be tailored to meet the individual needs of the candidate.This Parent Funding Opportunity Announcement is for basic science experimental studies involving humans, referred to in NOT-OD-18-212 as prospective basic science studies involving human participants. These studies fall within the NIH definition of a clinical trial and also meet the definition of basic research. Types of studies that should be submitted under this FOA include studies that prospectively assign human participants to conditions (i.e., experimentally manipulate independent variables) and that assess biomedical or behavioral outcomes in humans for the purpose of understanding the fundamental aspects of phenomena without specific application towards processes or products in mind. Applicants not planning an independent clinical trial or basic experimental study with humans, or proposing to gain research experience in a clinical trial or basic experimental study with humans led by another investigator, must apply to the &apos;Independent Clinical Trial Not Allowed&apos; companion FOA.

        "description": "Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are enabling extraordinary scientific breakthroughs in fields ranging from protein folding, natural language processing, drug synthesis, and recommender systems to the discovery of novel engineering materials and products. These achievements lie at the confluence of mathematics, statistics, engineering and computer science, yet a clear explanation of the remarkable power and also the limitations of such AI systems has eluded scientists from all disciplines. Critical foundational gaps remain that, if not properly addressed, will soon limit advances in machine learning, curbing progress in artificial intelligence. It appears increasingly unlikely that these critical gaps can be surmounted with increased computational power and experimentation alone. Deeper mathematical understanding is essential to ensuring that AI can be harnessed to meet the future needs of society and enable broad scientific discovery, while forestalling the unintended consequences of a disruptive technology. The National Science Foundation Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) will jointly sponsor research collaborations consisting of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, engineers, and social and behavioral scientists focused on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of AI. Research activities should focus on the most challenging mathematical and theoretical questions aimed at understanding the capabilities, limitations, and emerging properties of AI methods as well as the development of novel, and mathematically grounded, design and analysis principles for the current and next generation of AI approaches. Specific research goals include: establishing a fundamental mathematical understanding of thefactors determining the capabilities and limitations of current and emerging generations of AI systems, including, but not limited to, foundation models, generative models, deep learning, statistical learning, federated learning, and other evolving paradigms; the development of mathematically grounded design and analysis principles for the current and next generations of AI systems; rigorous approaches for characterizing and validating machine learning algorithms and their predictions; research enabling provably reliable, translational, general-purpose AI systems and algorithms; encouragement of new collaborations&#8239;in this interdisciplinary research community and between institutions. The overall goal is to establish innovative and principled design and analysis approaches for AI technology using creative yet theoretically grounded mathematical and statistical frameworks, yielding explainable and interpretable models that can enable sustainable, socially responsible, and trustworthy AI.

        "description": "Correctness for Scientific Computing Systems (CS2) is a joint program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE). The program addresses challenges that are both core to DOE&#8217;s mission and essential to NSF&#8217;s mission of ensuring broad scientific progress. The program&#8217;s overarching goal is to elevate correctness as a fundamental requirement for scientific computing tools and tool chains, spanning low-level libraries through complex multi-physics simulations and emerging scientific workflows. At an elementary level, correctness of a system means that desired behavioral properties will be satisfied during the system&#8217;s execution. In the context of scientific computing, correctness can be understood, at both the level of software and hardware, as absence of faulty behaviors such as excessive numerical rounding, floating-point exceptions, data races deadlocks, memory faults, violations of specifications at interfaces of system modules, and so on. The CS2 program puts correctness on an equal footing with performance, the focus of current scientific computing research. This program envisions the necessity of proving correctness even in performant scientific computing systems. Such correctness proofs themselves might rely upon multiple factors, including correctness of static and runtime program analyses. Recognizing that many scientific computing applications are inherently statistical, use probabilistic or randomized algorithms, and/or deal with uncertain data, probabilistic notions of correctness may be needed. It is also critical to realize that correctness guarantees are provided with respect to some pre-defined system model. For many reasons, including misspecification, approximation, and defect, the state space allowed by real systems might depart from that model. When this happens, the ability to probe the system to isolate the discrepancy is a key challenge in many domains. CS2 requires close and continuous collaboration between researchers in two complementary areas of expertise. One area is scientific computing, which, for this solicitation, is broadly construed to include: models and simulations of scientific theories; management and analysis of data from scientific simulations, observations, and experiments; libraries for numerical computation; and allied topics. The second area is formal reasoning and mechanized proving of properties of programs, which, for this solicitation, is broadly construed to include automatic/interactive/auto-active verification, runtime verification, type systems, abstract interpretation, programming languages, program analysis, program logic, compilers, concurrency, stochastic reasoning, static and dynamic testing, property-based testing, and allied topics.",

These partnerships are expected to establish cross-disciplinary centers focused on advancing fundamental engineering knowledge and engineered systems technology while exposing students to the integrative aspects of engineered systems and industrial practice. The goal of the ERC program has traditionally been to integrate engineering research and education with technological innovation to transform and improve national prosperity, health, and security. Building upon this tradition, NSF is interested in supporting ERCs to develop and advance engineered systems, which if successful, will have a high Societal Impact. The ERC program supports convergent research (CR) that will lead to strong societal impact. Each ERC has interacting foundational components that go beyond the research project, including engineering workforce development (EWD) at all participant stages, where all participants gain mutual benefit, and value creation within an innovation ecosystem (IE) that will outlast the lifetime of the ERC. These foundational elements are integrated throughout ERC activities and in alignment with the Center&apos;s vision and targeted societal impact.

        "description": "Fiscal Year 2024 Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Swift Current aims to better align the delivery of FMA flood mitigation funding to the disaster survivor experience. The purpose of FMA Swift Current is to reduce or eliminate the flood risk to NFIP-participating communities and repetitive flood damage to structures and buildings insured by the NFIP following a flood-related disaster event, and to enhance community flood resilience within NFIP-participating communities. It does so by providing funding for mitigation opportunities immediately after a flood disaster event with the aim of delivering mitigation outcomes. Swift Current is a grant opportunity under the FMA grant program. The FMA grant program makes federal funds available to states, U.S. territories, federally recognized tribal governments, and local governments to reduce or eliminate the risk of repetitive flood damage to buildings and structures insured under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), and within NFIP-participating communities. These include both acute extreme weather events and chronic stressors which have been observed and are expected to increase in intensity and frequency in the future.Applicants can submit applications for this funding opportunity through FEMA Grants Outcomes (GO).

        "description": "The NSF SBIR/STTR programs support moving scientific excellence and technological innovation from the lab to the market. By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and expands the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses. The NSF SBIR/STTR Phase II programs provide non-dilutive funding for thedevelopment of a broad range of technologiesbased on discoveries in science and engineeringwith potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses.The NSF SBIR/STTR programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services. The funding provided is non-dilutive. Any invention conceived or reduced to practice with the assistance of SBIR/STTR funding is subject to the Bayh/Dole Act. For more information, refer to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), #75. NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities. NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics: The innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation. The innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service. The innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible. The innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones). Once reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments. The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and start-ups and small businesses by translating new scientific and engineering concepts into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The program provides non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&amp;D) of use-inspired scientific and engineering activities for startups and small businesses. In Phase I, the emphasis is on de-risking those aspects preventing the innovation from reaching technical feasibility and driving the intended impact.In Phase II, R&amp;D continues, but the emphasis starts to shift away from research and to development challenges which, if solved, would result in new sustainable competitive advantages to allow the company to differentiate itself and drive new value propositions to the market and society. This NSF program is governed by15 USC 638and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC &#167;1861, et seq.). Introduction to the Program The SBIR and STTR programs were established in 1982 as part of the Small Business Innovation Development Act. The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The NSF SBIR/STTR programs are now part of theDirectorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.",

        "description": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computation and physical components. Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability that will expand the horizons of these critical systems. CPS technologies are transforming the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet has transformed the way people interact with information. New, smart CPS drive innovation and competition in a range of application domains including agriculture, aeronautics, building design, civil infrastructure, energy, environmental quality, healthcare and personalized medicine, manufacturing, and transportation. CPS are becoming data-rich enabling new and higher degrees of automation and autonomy. Traditional ideas in CPS research are being challenged by new concepts emerging from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The integration of artificial intelligence with CPS, especially for real-time operation, creates new research opportunities with major societal implications. While tremendous progress has been made in advancing CPS technologies, the demand for innovation across application domains is driving the need to accelerate fundamental research to keep pace. At the same time, the CPS program seeks to open new vistas for the research community to think beyond the usual cyber-physical paradigms and structures and propose creative ideas to address the myriad challenges of today&apos;s systems as well as those of the future that have not yet been designed or fielded. The CPS program aims to develop the core research needed to engineer these complex CPS, some of which may also require dependable, high-confidence, or provable behaviors. Core research areas of the program includecontrol, data analytics, and machinelearning including real-time learning for control, autonomy, design, Internet of Things (IoT), mixed initiatives including human-in- or human-on-the-loop, networking, privacy, real-time systems, safety, security, and verification. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program seeks to reveal cross-cutting, fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application domains. The program additionally supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and testbeds. This program also fosters a research community that is committed to advancing education and outreach in CPSand accelerating the transition of CPS research into the real world. All proposals must include the following as part of the Project Description: AResearch Descriptionthat describes the technical rationaleand technical approach of the CPS research, including the challenges that drive the research problem and how the research integrates cyber and physical components.This section must also describe how the research outcomes are translational to other application domains. Specifically, it must include: A subsection titled &quot;CPS Research Focus&quot; which describes the cyber-physical system attributes of the challenge problem and clearly identifies the core CPS research areas addressed in which the novel and foundational research contributions are being made. This is intended as not a list of core areas but a focused discussion with content An Evaluation/Experimentation Plan that describes how proposed concepts will be validated and outlines the metrics for success; A Project Management and Collaboration Plan that summarizes how the project team is ideally suited to realize the project goals and how the team will ensure effective collaboration; NSF is working closely with multiple agencies across the federal government, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T); the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); and the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA, hereafter referred to as NIFA). Proposals for three classes of research and education projects&#8212;differing in scope and goals&#8212;are supported through the CPS program: Smallprojects mayrequest a total budget of up to $600,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to emerging new and innovative ideas that may have high impact on the field of CPS. Small projects proposals may be submitted at anytime during the year-long annual submission window. Medium projects may request a total budget ranging from $600,001 to $1,200,000 for a period of up to 3 years. They are well suited to multi-disciplinary projects that accomplish clear goals requiring integrated perspectives spanning the disciplines. Medium Projects proposals may be submitted at anytime during the year-long annual submission window. Frontierprojects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Furthermore, Frontier projects should also look to push the boundaries of CPS well beyond today&apos;s systems and capabilities. Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,001 to $7,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years. Note that the Frontier projects have a specific deadline. ",

        "description": "The NSF SBIR/STTR and SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support moving scientific excellence and technological innovation from the lab to the market. By funding startups and small businesses, NSF helps build a strong national economy and stimulates the creation of novel products, services, and solutions in private, public, or government sectors with potential for broad impact; strengthens the role of small business in meeting federal research and development needs; increases the commercial application of federally supported research results; and develops and increases the US workforce, especially by fostering and encouraging participation by socially and economically disadvantaged and women-owned small businesses. These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs provide fixed amount cooperative agreements for thedevelopment of a broad range of technologiesbased on discoveries in science and engineeringwith potential for societal and economic impacts. Unlike fundamental or basic research activities that focus on scientific and engineering discovery itself, the NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs support the creation of opportunities to move use-inspired and translational discoveries out of the lab and into the market or other use at scale, through startups and small businesses.The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs do not solicit specific technologies or procure goods and services from startups and small businesses.Any invention conceivedorreduced to practice with the assistance ofSBIR/STTR fundingis subject to the Bayh-Dole Act. For more information refer toSBIR/STTR Frequently Asked Questions #75. NSF promotes inclusion by encouraging proposals from diverse populations and geographic locations. The traditional NSF SBIR/STTR programs include two funding Phases &#8211; Phase I and Phase II. All proposers to the programs must first apply for Phase I funding &#8211; there is no direct-to-Phase II option. Under a traditional NSF SBIR/STTR Phase I award, a small business can receive non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&amp;D) to demonstrate technical feasibility over 6 to 12 months and then, after completion of a Phase I project, companies may apply for Phase II funding to further develop the proposed technology. There aresignificantbenefits for SBIR/STTRFast-Track recipients:the submission of only oneproposalfor Phase I and Phase IIand a faster transition from Phase I to Phase II.While startups and small businesses face many challenges, NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track funding is intended to specifically focus on challenges associated with technological innovation; that is, on the creation of new products, services, and other scalable solutions based on fundamental science or engineering. A successful Fast-Track proposal must demonstrate how NSF funding will help the small business create a proof-of-concept or prototype by retiring technical risk. NSF seeks unproven, leading-edge, technology innovations that demonstrate the following characteristics: The innovations are underpinned and enabled by a new scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation. The innovations still require intensive technical research and development to be fully embedded in a reliable product or service. The innovations have not yet been reduced to practice by anyone and it is not guaranteed, at present, that doing so is technically possible. The innovations provide a strong competitive advantage that are not easily replicable by competitors (even technically proficient ones). Once reduced to practice, the innovations are expected to result in a product or service that would either be disruptive to existing markets or create new markets/new market segments. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and start-ups by translating new scientific and engineering concepts into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. The programs provide non-dilutive funding for research and development (R&amp;D) of use-inspired scientific and engineering activities at the earliest stages of the company and technology development. During the course of the award, the emphasis is expected to shift from de-risking those aspects preventing the innovation from reaching technical feasibility and driving the intended impact to a greater focus on commercially relevant development activities that will allow the company to differentiate itself and drive new value propositions to the market and society. NSF encourages input and participation from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities. These NSF programs are governed by15 USC 638and the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as amended (42 USC &#167;1861, et seq.). Introduction to the Program The NSF SBIR/STTR programs focus on stimulating technical innovation from diverse entrepreneurs and startups by translating new scientific and engineering discoveries emerging from the private sector, federal labs, and academia into products and services that can be scaled and commercialized into sustainable businesses with significant societal benefits. These NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs enable companies based on previous NSF awards (NSF award lineage) to submita single proposalthat, if awarded, can provide a faster pathway from Phase I to Phase II funding.Receipt of full funding under the Fast-Track pilot programs is contingent on the results of a company&#8217;s Phase II transition review. The NSF SBIR/STTR Fast-Track pilot programs are part of theDirectorate for Technology, Innovation and Partnerships (TIP), which was recently launched to accelerate innovation and enhance economic competitiveness by catalyzing partnerships and investments that strengthen the links between fundamental research and technology development, deployment, and use.",

        "description": "The intent of this solicitation is to request proposals from organizations who are willing to serve as resource providers within the NSF Advanced Computing Systems and Services (ACSS) program. Resource providers would (1) provide advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources in production operations to support the full range of computation, data-analysis, and AI research across all of science and engineering (S&amp;E), and (2) enable democratized and equitable access to the proposed resources. The current solicitation is intended to complement previous NSF investments in advanced computational infrastructure by provisioning resources, broadly defined in this solicitation to include systems and services, in two categories: Category I, Capacity Resources: production computational resources maximizing the capacity provided to support the broad range of computation, data analytics and AI needs in S&amp;E research; and Category II, Innovative Prototypes/Testbeds: innovative forward-looking capabilities deploying novel technologies, architectures, usage modes, etc., and exploring new target applications, methods, and paradigms. Resource Providers supported via this solicitation will be incorporated into NSF&#8217;s ACSS 2.0 program portfolio. This program complements investments in leadership-class computing and funds a federation of nationally available advanced computing resources that are technically diverse and intended to enable discoveries at a computational scale beyond the research of individual or regional academic institutions. NSF anticipates that at least 90% of the provisioned resource will be available to the S&amp;E community through an open peer-reviewed national allocation process and have resource users be supported by community and other support services. Such allocation and support services are expected to be coordinated through the NSF-funded Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services &amp; Support (ACCESS) , the National AI Research Resource, or an NSF-approved alternative as may emerge. Provisioning novel, diverse computational resources nationally at scale will require capability and capacity to support researchers who need assistance to use these resources. User support may be provided via various means, e.g., training sessions, documentation, direct engagement in response to tickets created via the ACCESS program, or integration of novel, NSF-funded software tools. The ACSS 2.0 Program seeks broad representation of PIs across the full spectrum of diverse community talent (including the participation of groups that have traditional been underrepresented in the cyberinfrastructure community) and institutions (including those that have not historically provided nationally allocatable cyberinfrastructure) in both the community of resource recipients and resources users to continue growing the scale and diversity of the S&amp;E community. Submission from or partnership with EPSCoR institutions and institutions that have not previously received ACSS awards is encouraged.",

The projects must focus on products related to the mission and goals of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and may evaluate drugs, biologics, devices, or diagnostics, as well as surgical, behavioral or rehabilitation therapies. Since conducting the clinical trials needed for commercialization may be capital-intensive, the FOA aims to facilitate the transition of SBIR Phase II projects to the commercialization stage by promoting partnerships between NIH&apos;s SBIR/STTR awardees and third-party investors and/or strategic partners. Consistent with the goals of this funding initiative and as required by the SF424 instructions for all SBIR Phase II applications, applicants must submit a Commercialization Plan, which should include details on any independent third-party investor funding that has already been secured or is anticipated during the project period. It is expected that the level of this independent third-party funding will equal or exceed the NINDS funds being requested throughout the SBIR Phase IIB project period.",

        "description": "With a focus on two-year Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program supports the education of technicians for the high-technology fields that drive our nation&apos;s economy. The program involves partnerships between academic institutions (grades 7-12, IHEs), industry, and economic development agencies to promote improvement in the education of science and engineering technicians. It is strongly recommended that projects be faculty-led and required that courses and programs are credit-bearing, although materials developed may also be used for incumbent worker education. Materials may also be adapted and implemented as credit-bearing courses. The ATE program supports curriculum development; professional development of college faculty and secondary school teachers; career pathway development for both students and incumbent workers; and other activities including applied research projects that advance the knowledge base related to technician education. The ATE program encourages partnerships with other entities that may impact technician education. For example, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Manufacturing Extension Partnerships (MEPs) (http://www.nist.gov/mep/index.cfm) as applicable to support technician education programs and the industries they serve; and Manufacturing USA Institutes(https://manufacturing.gov/) addressing workforce development issues. The ATE program encourages proposals from Minority Serving Institutionsas well as other institutions that support the recruitment, retention, and completion (certificate, degree, program)of the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer, which includes underrepresented and underserved communities, in STEM technician education programs that award associate degrees.",

        "description": "The National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act1aims to ensure the continuing leadership of the United States (U.S.) in quantum information science and technology. In conformance with the NQI goals, an argument2-5was set forth for a renewed emphasis on identifying and fostering early adoption of quantum technologies to transform the field of Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) and to accelerate broader impacts on society. A systematic approach to maturing quantum technology platforms by integrating end-users and potential customers from other fields of science and engineering and other sectors of the economy into cycles of research, development, and demonstration should lower the barriers for end-users to pioneer new applications. NSF support for use-inspired and translational research in QISE, combined with continued strong support of the underlying foundational research, is anticipated to accelerate development of a market for quantum technologies. With this program solicitation, the Foundation is taking the next step in implementing the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory (NQVL) concept as an overarching shared infrastructure designed to facilitate the translation from basic science and engineering to the resultant technology, while at the same time emphasizing and advancing its scientific and technical value. The NQVL aims to develop and utilize use-inspired and application-oriented quantum technologies. In the process, NQVL researchers will explore quantum frontiers6, foster the development of QISE education and workforce development strategies, engage in outreach activities at all levels, and promote input and participation from the full spectrum of talent in QISE, thereby lowering barriers at all entry points of the research enterprise. Engagement with all sectors of the United States (U.S.) QISE community will be necessary for this initiative to succeed, and, indeed, the project is designed to include participation from a full spectrum of organizations who have expertise to contribute. In particular, NSF recognizes that the involvement of industry partners is essential and will welcome these to be a part of the overall structure. Partnerships with other U.S. Federal agencies under the NQI umbrella are also encouraged. While this solicitation lays out the vision for the entire NQVL program that includes Quantum Science and Technology Demonstration (QSTD) projects, support for enabling technologies through Transformative Advances in Quantum Systems (TAQS), as well as a central coordination hub, only proposals for Design- and Implementation-phase QSTDs are solicited at this time. Submission of a QSTD:Design proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Pilot project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Conceptual Design Review of the QSTD:Pilot project. The QSTD:Design project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Pilot phase. Submission of a QSTD:Implementation proposal is contingent upon the existence of a QSTD:Design project in the same topical area, and the positive recommendation from the Preliminary Design Review of the QSTD:Design project. The QSTD:Implementation project builds on progress made in the QSTD:Design phase. It is required that prospective PIs contact the NQVL Program Officer(s) as soon as possible, but not later than two weeks before submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, to ascertain that the focus and budget of their proposal is appropriate for this solicitation.

Clinical Coordinating Centers (CCC) should develop and implement the proposed fully powered multi-site clinical trial (Phase III and beyond). The objective of a CCC application is to present the scientific rationale and a comprehensive scientific and operational plan for the clinical trial. CCC applications are expected to describe plans for project management, participant recruitment and retention strategies, performance milestones, scientific conduct, and dissemination of results. CCC applications submitted under this NOFO will utilize a two-phase, milestone-driven cooperative agreement (UG3/UH3) funding mechanism.

It is responsible for the collection, acquisition, analysis, reporting and dissemination of objective, statistical data related to the science and technology (S&amp;T) enterprise in the United States and other nations that is relevant and useful to practitioners, researchers, policymakers and the public. NCSES uses this information to prepare a number of statistical data reports including Women, Minorities and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering and the National Science Board&apos;s biennial report, Science and Engineering (S&amp;E) Indicators. The Center would like to enhance its efforts to support analytic and methodological research in support of its surveys as well as promote the education and training of researchers in the use of large-scale nationally representative datasets. NCSES welcomes efforts by the research community to use NCSES or other data to conduct research on the S&amp;T enterprise, develop improved survey methodologies that could benefit NCSES surveys, explore alternate data sources that could supplement NCSES data, create and improve indicators of S&amp;T activities and resources, strengthen methodologies to analyze S&amp;T statistical data, and explore innovative ways to communicate S&amp;T statistics. To that end, NCSES invites proposals for individual or multi-investigator research projects, doctoral dissertation improvement awards, conferences, experimental research, survey research and data collection, and dissemination projects under its program for Research on the Science and Technology Enterprise: Indicators, Statistics, and Methods (NCSES S&amp;T).",

The overarching goal of this R25 program is to encourage individuals who have not had substantial biomedical research experience, or who have the potential to significantly benefit from additional biomedical research experience to pursue further studies or careers in research. To accomplish the stated over-arching goal, this NOFO will support educational activities with a primary focus on: (1) Research Experiences, (2) Curriculum or Methods Development and (3) Outreach. The NCI&#8217;s mission is to conduct and support research, training, health information dissemination, and other programs concerning cancer. This funding opportunity seeks to facilitate educational activities that encourage students to become knowledgeable about cancer and available to focus on cancer later in their careers. To promote broad interest in pursuing a career in biomedical research via early intervention strategies, the NCI Youth Enjoy Science (YES) Program will support efforts to create and maintain an institutional program to engage grades 6-12 and/or undergraduate students in cutting edge cancer research experiences. The proposed institutional programs may also provide research experiences for the grade 6-12 teachers and undergraduate faculty members. The goals are to inspire interest in biomedical sciences, help envision research as a career path, and strengthen practical research and career skills. In alignment with these goals, institutions may develop unique programs that capitalize on their research strengths and are responsive to their target populations.",

These organizations are underrepresented among those receiving NHGRI funding for ELSI research. The Building Partnerships and Broadening Perspectives to Advance Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI) Research (BPAER) Program will support: 1) transdisciplinary ELSI research addressing timely, complex, and understudied topics, 2) the establishment of research teams that include representatives from relevant communities who are affected by and have an interest in the proposed research, 3) research capacity building to develop, conduct and sustain ELSI research, and 4) workforce development opportunities for early career scholars, research team members, and other research project staff. Transdisciplinary ELSI research projects require involvement from two or more fields of knowledge and use of multiple research approaches. Relevant communities must be actively and meaningfully involved on ELSI research teams across all phases of proposed research projects. Research capacity building plans must be informed by a needs assessment. Given the complex structure, a strategic management plan, evaluation plan, and sustainability plan are required to ensure successful completion of the program.",

ERCs are academic institutions that provide high-quality interdisciplinary graduate and post-graduate training, research training, continuing education, and outreach in the core occupational safety and health disciplines of industrial hygiene, occupational health nursing, occupational medicine, and occupational safety, as well as allied disciplines. Research and research training are integral components of ERCs, with ERC faculty and NIOSH trainees conducting research on issues related to the NIOSH National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) and emerging issues to advance the field of occupational safety and health. NIOSH ERCs have regional presence to further diversify the occupational safety and health profession through their core values, mission statements, and outputs. ERCs serve as resources for our nation&apos;s workforce through continuing education, outreach and strong collaboration with professional associations, worker advocacy groups, businesses, industries, and public health agencies. ERCs work with other institutions and organizations, including Minority Serving Institutions and other NIOSH supported training programs to have a positive impact on worker health, safety, and well-being.",

        "description": "The Science and Technology Centers (STC): Integrative Partnerships program supports exceptionally innovative, complex research and education projects that require large-scale, long-term awards. STCs focus on creating new scientific paradigms, establishing entirely new scientific disciplines, and developing transformative technologies which have the potential for broad scientific or societal impact. STCs conduct world-class research through partnerships amonginstitutions of higher education, national laboratories, industrial organizations, other public or private entities, and via international collaborations, as appropriate. They provide a means to undertake potentially groundbreaking investigations at the interfaces of disciplines and/or highly innovative approaches within disciplines. STCs may involve any area of science and engineering that NSF supports. STC investments support the NSF vision of creating and exploiting new concepts in science and engineering and providing global leadership in research and education. Centers provide a rich environment for encouraging scientists, engineers, and educators to take risks in pursuing discoveries and new knowledge. STCs foster excellence in education by integrating education and research, and by creating connections between learning and inquiry so that discovery and creativity fully support the learning process. NSF encourages input and participation in the STC program from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer which includes underrepresented and underserved communities. In addition, NSF expects STCs to both involve individuals who are members of groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in science, engineering and mathematics at all levels within the Center (faculty, staff, students, and postdoctoral researchers) as well as be a leader in broadening participation in STEM. Centers may use either proven or innovative mechanisms based on the relevant literature to address matters such as recruitment, retention, success, and career progression of all individuals in the Center. Along with research, education and broadening participation, Centers must undertake activities that facilitate knowledge transfer, i.e., the exchange of scientific and technical information with the objective of disseminating and utilizing knowledge broadly in multiple sectors. Examples of knowledge transfer include technology transfer, providing key information to public policy-makers, or dissemination of knowledge from one field of science to another.",

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) Children&quot;s Bureau (CB) recognizes that every child who dies as a result of child abuse or neglect represents an irreversible and deep trauma to families and communities. Preventing child fatalities is an urgent public health concern that demands meaningful action. Understanding the circumstances surrounding the tragedy of a child fatality through improved data collection, reporting, and analysis of all child fatalities is essential for prevention. The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to establish, by cooperative agreement, the National Center on Child Maltreatment Fatality Data Practices (the National Center) to improve data collection and reporting about child maltreatment fatalities. Effective cross-agency coordination and understanding of child maltreatment fatality data can help states collect comprehensive data. States, jurisdictions, and their partners, including tribes, can use that information to develop cross-agency prevention, intervention, and system reform efforts.The National Center will make and carry out a plan to provide culturally responsive T/TA to states, jurisdictions, and their partners, including tribes. This will enable these groups to better execute the goals of this funding and measure the effectiveness of implemented efforts. The National Center will focus on the following objectives: Building knowledge and capacity.Increasing opportunities for cross-agency cooperation and coordination.Establishing a national resource for information-sharing, learning, and dissemination.Supporting data practice and reporting strategies.Evaluating training and technical assistance activities.",

These funds only become available when the President declares a Major Disaster under the Robert T. Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and may only be used in those areas designated in the Disaster Declaration issued by the President of the United States under the Robert T. Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance Act. Eligible SUAs and Title VI grantees should discuss all disaster applications with ACL Regional staff before submitting a formal application. The amount of funds requested should be discussed with Regional staff before the application is completed. Providing a draft of the narrative justification for the application to the Regional Office will help expedite the processing of an award. Applicants should talk with the State and local Emergency Managers to determine what funds may be available through other resources before applying for OAA funding. SUAs, and federally recognized Tribal Organizations currently receiving a grant under Title VI of the OAA must submit proposals electronically via http://www.grants.gov. At http//www.grants.gov, you will be able to download a copy of the application packet, complete it off-line, and then upload and submit the application via the Grants.gov website",

Phenotypes associated with addictive behaviors and/or vulnerability to distinct stages along the substance use disorders (SUD) trajectory (e.g. initial/acute use, escalation of use, acquisition of tolerance, dependence, uncontrolled use, abstinence and relapse or recovery); 2. Behaviors associated with SUD (e.g. impulsivity, novelty seeking, delayed discounting, and other genetically-associated phenotypes); and 3. Comorbidities that demonstrate genetic correlations with phenotypes and behaviors linked with SUD (e.g. anxiety, stress, poor maternal care, social defeat, and other paradigms). Applications may examine any type of genomic variant, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, large and small structural variants, and all types of mobile DNA. NIDA encourages applications that take genomics, multi-omics, and/or data-based approaches that integrate multi-level omics data, delineate gene networks, and/or uncover the function of known or newly discovered genetic or epigenetic variants. Other areas of interest include genomics analysis at the circuit level and the application of neuroscience to genomics studies. NIDA expects these studies to uncover novel mechanisms that contribute to various stages across the SUD trajectory and inform future studies about potential targets and therapeutic strategies for addiction.",

        "description": "This Broad Agency Announcement is a mechanism to encourage research, education and outreach, innovative projects, or sponsorships that are not addressed through NOAA&#8217;s competitive discretionary programs. This announcement is not soliciting goods or services for the direct benefit of NOAA. Funding for activities described in this notice is contingent upon the availability of appropriations in the fiscal years applicable to the application. Applicants are hereby given notice that funds have not yet been appropriated for any activities described in this notice. Publication of this announcement does not oblige NOAA to review an application beyond an initial administrative review, or to award any specific project, or to obligate any available funds.NOAA Ocean Exploration is dedicated to exploring the unknown ocean, unlocking its potential through scientific discovery, technological advancements, and data delivery. By working closely with partners across public, private, and academic sectors, we are filling gaps in our basic understanding of the marine environment. This allows us, collectively, to protect ocean health, sustainably manage our marine resources, accelerate our national economy, better understand our changing environment, and enhance appreciation of the importance of the ocean in our everyday lives. NOAA Ocean Exploration operates an education program to raise awareness of the importance of the ocean, ocean exploration, and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) education and is committed to improving America&#8217;s environmental literacy by bringing the excitement of ocean exploration and discovery to a wide variety of diverse audiences. Educators and public and private partnerships are essential to this mission. NOAA Ocean Exploration offers many opportunities for educators to learn about NOAA science and technology associated with exploring the ocean in their classrooms. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, school systems have largely reopened but the landscape of the classroom has changed. While many educators and classrooms have evolved to hybrid learning environments, so too have NOAA Ocean Exploration&#8217;s education product and delivery methods. Virtual and online offerings have expanded the education program&#8217;s audience, reaching previously untapped educators increasing accessibility and inclusion for increasingly-diverse classrooms. Successful proposals directly support NOAA Ocean Exploration priorities including increasing diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility in the education program; and developing education resources to complement virtual and hybrid education delivery. In addition, successful proposals typically involve multiple partners; are characterized by an interdisciplinary and innovative exploration approach; frequently leverage other programs and organizations with compatible objectives; produce information that will be valuable to state and federal marine resource managers; give consideration to environmental impacts in the project planning and represent the applicant&apos;s ability to acquire all necessary permits; explain the plan for making data and results publicly available to advance scientific knowledge and inform environmental management decisions; and provide a plan for diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) activities.",

        "description": "NSF-supported science and engineering research increasingly relies on cutting-edge infrastructure. With its Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program and Major Multi-user Facilities (&quot;Major Facilities&quot;) projects, NSF supports infrastructure projects at the lower and higher range of infrastructure project costs, Foundation-wide, across science and engineering research disciplines. The Foundation-wide Mid-scale Research Infrastructure opportunity is intended to provide NSF with an agile, Foundation-wide process to fund experimental research capabilities in the mid-scale range between MRI and Major Multi-user Facilities. NSF defines Research Infrastructure (RI) as any combination of facilities, equipment, instrumentation, or computational hardware or software, and the necessary human capital in support of the same. Major facilities and mid-scale projects are subsets of research infrastructure. The NSF Mid-scale Research Infrastructure-1 Program (Mid-scale RI-1) supports either design activities or implementation of unique and compelling RI projects. Mid-scale implementation projects may include any combination of equipment, instrumentation, cyberinfrastructure, broadly used large scale datasets and the personnel needed to successfully commission the project. Mid-scale RI-1 design activities include the design efforts intended to lead to eventual implementation of a mid-scale class RI project. Mid-scale RI-1 projects should involve the training of a diverse workforce engaged in the design and implementation of STEM research infrastructure. Mid-scale RI-1 projects should directly enable advances in any of the research domains supported by NSF. Projects may also include upgrades to existing research infrastructure. Mid-scale RI-1 emphasizes strong scientific merit, a response to an identified need of the research community and/or fulfillment of a national need to enable U.S. researchers to be competitive in a global research environment. Well-conceived technical and management plans are essential for both design and implementation proposals, as are well-developed plans (e.g., mentoring and professional development) for student training and the involvement of a diverse STEM workforce in all aspects of mid-scale design and/or implementation activities. The inclusion of individual project participants that will lead to a supportive working environment is especially encouraged at all levels of the project team. Within Mid-scale RI-1, proposers may submit two types of projects, &#8220;Implementation&#8221; (e.g., acquisition and/or construction) or &#8220;Design&#8221;. The &#8220;Design&#8221; track is intended to facilitate progress toward readiness for a mid-scale range implementation project. Both Implementation projects and Design activities may involve new or upgraded research infrastructure. Mid-scale RI-1 &quot;Implementation&quot; projects may have a total project cost ranging from $4 million up to but not including $20 million. Mid-scale RI-1 &quot;Design&quot; activities may request less than $4 million, with a minimum request of $400,000 and a maximum request up to but not including $20 million, as appropriate, to prepare for a future mid-scale range implementation project. Note: Successful award of a Mid-scale RI-1 design activity does not imply NSF&apos;s commitment to the future implementation of the project being designed, nor is a Mid-scale RI-1 design award required for the submission of an implementation project. The Mid-scale RI-1 Program seeks to broaden the representation of PIs and institutions in its award portfolio, including a geographically diverse set of institutions (especially those in EPSCoR jurisdictions). Proposals submitted by, or involving partnerships between institutions are encouraged. Participation in this opportunity is encouraged for the full spectrum of diverse talent society has to offer to include PIs who are women, early-career researchers, persons with disabilities, or members of other groups underrepresented in STEM. To improve participation in science and engineering research for persons with disabilities, Mid-scale RI-1 encourages PIs to incorporate accessibility as part of Mid-scale RI-1 design activity and implementation projects. Please consult NSF&apos;s Research Infrastructure Guide, or RIG (available at https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/lfo/lfo_documents.jsp), for definitions of certain terms used in this solicitation, such as the Project Execution Plan (PEP) and Design and Execution Plan (DEP). The RIG provides guidance specific to Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Projects, including references to other parts of the RIG as needed. Note that PEP or DEP should be appropriately scaled for the complexity of the project and may not require all of the elements described in the RIG. Mid-scale research infrastructure projects with total project costs beyond the Mid-scale RI-1 Program limit are separately solicited through the Mid-scale RI-2 Program. Proposals to the Mid-scale RI-1 Program with total project costs outside of this solicitation&apos;s budgetary limits, either during initial submission or after cost analyses/revisions during subsequent review, are subject to return without further review.",

        "description": "Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes are large-scale interdisciplinary research projects motivated by major challenges at the frontiers of quantum information science and technology (QIST). Institutes are expected to catalyze breakthroughs on important problems underpinning QIST, for example in the focus areas of quantum computation, quantum communication, quantum simulation and/or quantum sensing. Successful institutes willcoordinate a variety of approaches to specific scientific, technological, and educational goals in these fields, including multiple institutions and building upon multiple disciplines, as motivated by the science and engineering challenges. In so doing, Institutes willnurture a culture of discovery, provide education, training, and workforce development opportunities in the context of cutting-edge research, and demonstrate value-added from synergistic coordination within the institute and with the broader community. Partnerships, infrastructure, industry engagement, outreach, international collaboration, and new applications for QIST should be fostered by Institutes in support of their research, education, and coordination goals. The QLCI program can support awards to continue existing Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes or to establish and operate new Quantum LeapChallenge Institutes. In either case, proposers should follow the same guidance for Challenge Institute proposal preparation described in this solicitation. While this is a crosscutting program, proposals responding to this solicitation must be submitted to the Office of Strategic Initiatives (OSI) in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). They will subsequently be managed by a cross-disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors. The QLCI program enables NSF multidisciplinary centers for quantum research and educationas called for in the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act1and an NQI Advisory Committee report, Renewing the National Quantum Initiative: Recommendations for Sustaining American Leadership in Quantum Information Science2.In alignment with the NQI Act, Quantum Leap Challenge Institutes shall pursueresearch at the frontiers of quantum information science, engineering, and technology, and explore solutions to important challenges for the development, application, commercialization, and pioneering use of quantum technologies.QLCI Institutes shall also lead education, training, and workforce development activities as may be needed for sustained leadership in QIST and related topics. Coordination both within each Institute and with new partners and the broader ecosystem should also serve to galvanize the community and catalyze the research and education activities in ways that go beyond what smaller projects could accomplish in isolation. 1National Quantum Initiative Act, Public Law 115-368, of December 21, 2018. 2https://www.quantum.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NQIAC-Report-Renewing-the-National-Quantum-Initiative.pdf",

Projects funded by AISL should contribute to research and practice that further illuminates informal STEM learning&#8217;s role in engagement, broadening participation, and belonging in STEM; personal and educational success in STEM; advancing public engagement in scientific discovery; fostering interest in STEM careers; creating and enhancing the theoretical and empirical foundations for effective informal STEM learning; improving community vibrancy; and/or enhancing science communication and the public&#8217;s engagement in and understanding of STEM and STEM processes. The AISL Program funds five types of projects: (1) Synthesis; (2) Conference; (3) Partnership Development and Planning; (4) Integrating Research and Practice; and (5) Research in Support of Wide-reaching Public Engagement with STEM. NOTES: Activities primarily focused on formal educational systems or outcomes are outside the scope of work supported by this program. AISL does not fund formal elementary, middle, or high school, or undergraduate or graduate education, whether in-person or online. Similarly, AISL does not fund formal workforce training (e.g., professional certifications and degree-earning programs) that is not aimed directly at informal STEM learning professionals. While the language in the Broadening Participation in STEM section draws attention to the diversity of institutions of higher education (IHEs), the AISL program encourages submissions from the full spectrum of diverse talent that society has to offer to include those from Non-profit, Non-academic Organizations, and Tribal Nations as core to the program&#8217;s Broadening Participation and overall efforts to engage the diverse talent from communities and advance informal STEM education. Non-profit, Non-academic Organizations are directly associated with educational or research activities but do not grant degrees. They include but are not limited to independent museums, observatories, research laboratories, professional societies, and similar organizations located in the U.S. The term &#8220;Tribal Nation&#8221; means an American Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the Interior acknowledges as a federally recognized tribe pursuant to the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994, 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5130-5131.

        "description": "The primary objective of the Cultural Anthropology Program is to support basic scientific research on the causes, consequences and complexities of human social and cultural variability. Contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid in investigations of human cultural variation. Recognizing the breadth of the field&apos;s contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, fieldwork/lab-based theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation&apos;s mission is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice, humanistic understanding or applied policy. A proposal that applies anthropological methods to a social problem but does not propose how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing and/or theory-expanding contribution to anthropology will be returned without review. Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of: Sociocultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization and poverty. Resilience and robustness of sociocultural systems. Scientific principles underlying conflict, cooperation and altruism, as well as explanations of variation in culture, norms, behaviors and institutions. Economy, culture, migration and globalization. Variability and change in kinship and family norms and practices. General cultural and social principles underlining the drivers of health outcomes and disease transmission. Biocultural work that considers the nexus of human culture and its relationship with human biology. Social regulation, governmentality and violence. Origins of complexity in sociocultural systems. Language and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics and cognition. Theoretically-informed approaches to co-production in relation to scientific understandings of human variability and environmental stewardship. Mathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, multi-level models, and modes that integrate agent-based simulations and geographic information systems (GIS). Socio-cultural drivers of technology and technological systems such as AI, machine learning, augmented data, and platforms. As part of its effort to encourage and support projects that explicitly integrate education and basic research, CA provides support to enhance and improve the conduct of doctoral dissertation projects designed and carried out by doctoral students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education who are conducting scientific research that enhances basic scientific knowledge.",

        "description": "The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. Many NSF-funded projects result in publicly accessible, modifiable, and distributable open-source products, including software, hardware, models, specifications, programming languages, or data platforms that catalyze further innovation. In some cases, an open-source product that shows potential for wide adoption forms the basis for a self-sustaining open-source ecosystem (OSE) that comprises a leadership team; a managing organization with a well-defined governance structure and distributed development model; a cohesive community of external intellectual content developers; and a broad base of users across academia, industry, and/or government. The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of managing organizations will ensure adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations based on anexisting open-source product or class of products, whereby each organization is responsible for the creation and management of processes and infrastructure needed for the efficient and secure development and maintenance of an OSE. POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate scientific innovations, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like theNSF Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps&#8482;)andAmerica&#8217;s Seed Fund[Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)]represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational pathway &#8211; supporting the transition from open-source research artifacts to OSEs. Importantly, the POSE program isnotintended to fund thedevelopmentof open-source products, including tools and artifacts. The POSE program is alsonotintended to fund existing well-resourced, open-source communities or ecosystems. Instead, the program aims to supportnewmanaging organizations to catalyze distributed, community-driven development and growth ofnewOSEs. The expected outcomes of the POSE program are to grow the community of researchers and innovators who develop and contribute to OSE efforts, and to enable pathways for the safe and secure development of OSEs that have broad societal impacts. OSEs can emerge from any areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) research and development. This solicitation seeks two types of proposals, allowing teams to propose specific activities toscope and planthe establishment of an OSE (Phase I), and toestablisha sustainable OSE based on a robust open-source product that shows promise in the ability to both meet an emergent societal or national need and build a community to help develop it (Phase II). Phase I: OSE Scoping and Planning Proposals Phase I projects are for open-source research products with a small community of external users though the product may not necessarily have external content developers. The objectives of Phase I projects are to: (1) enable scoping activities that will inform the transition of promising research products that are already available in open-source formats into sustainable and robust OSEs that will have broad societal impacts, and (2) provide training to teams interested in building such an OSE. Phase I awardees are not obligated to submit Phase II proposals in the future. Phase II: Establishment and Expansion Proposals Phase II projects are for open-source research products with small, existing communities of external usersandexternal content developers. The objective of Phase II projects is to support the transition of a promising open-source product into a sustainable and robust OSE. Phase II proposal teams are expected to have already conducted the scoping activities needed to develop a detailed project plan to support the community-driven distributed development and deployment of successful open-source tools into operational environments (not necessarily via a Phase I award). An NSF POSE Phase I award is not required for the submission of a Phase II proposal.",

        "description": "This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) seeks applications for proof-of-concept testing and development of new technologies and novel approaches for recording and modulation of neural cells and circuits, to address major challenges and enable transformative understanding of dynamic signaling in the central nervous system. Preliminary feasibility data are not required, and it is expected that the proposed research may be high-risk, but if successful could profoundly change the course of neuroscience research. Applications may propose development of instrumentation hardware and/or devices and associated software, and/or molecular constructs for sensing and manipulating neural activity. Approaches may utilize any modality such as optical, electrical, magnetic, or acoustic recording/manipulation, to target neuronal electrical signals or other forms of neural activity, including intracellular signaling and engagement of non-neuronal cells in circuit function. A companion NOFO (RFA-NS-25-017) is targeted to projects focused on optimization of instrumentation and devices that are later in the development cycle, where iterative optimization and end-user testing is needed. The companion NOFO does not allow projects primarily focused on development or optimization of molecular constructs for recording and manipulating neural activity. Projects of this nature are supported by this NOFO and other BRAIN Initiative announcements including RFA-MH-22-245, RFA-MH-21-175, and RFA-EY-21-001 (or their reissue). For this and the companion NOFO, the aim of the proposed technologies should be to reduce major barriers to conducting neurobiological experiments, including considerations of cost and ease of access, and to enable new discoveries for understanding neural circuit function. Technologies should address major challenges associated with recording and modulating CNS activity, at cellular or circuit resolution, and should contribute to an overall ecosystem of technologies spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales in any region throughout the CNS. The approaches should be compatible with experiments in behaving animals, with an expectation that they will be validated with in vivo experiments during the course of the project. Proposed validation experiments must focus on demonstrating the capabilities and potential impact of the technology, rather than advancing the state of biological knowledge as the primary project goal. Applications are encouraged to integrate multiple approaches, and where appropriate, to leverage a variety of domains of expertise from biological, chemical, and physical sciences, engineering, computational modeling, and statistical analysis.",

To respond to the growing threats to the safety, security, and privacy of open-source ecosystems (OSEs), NSF is launching theSafety, Security, and Privacy for Open-Source Ecosystems(Safe-OSE) program. This program solicits proposals from OSEs, including those not originally funded byNSF&#8217;s Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)program, to address significant safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities, both technical (e.g., vulnerabilities in code and side-channels) and socio-technical (e.g., supply chain, insider threats). Although most open-source products are software-based, it is important to note that Safe-OSE applies to any type of OSE, including those based on scientific methodologies, models, and processes; manufacturing processes and process specifications; materials formulations; programming languages and formats; hardware instruction sets; system designs or specifications; and data platforms. The goal of the Safe-OSE program is to catalyze meaningful improvements in the safety, security, and privacy of the targeted OSE that the OSE does not currently have the resources to undertake. Funds from this program should be directed toward efforts to enhance the safety, security, and privacy characteristics of the open-source product and its supply chain as well as to bolster the ecosystem&#8217;s capabilities for managing current and future risks, attacks, breaches, and responses.",

        "description": "This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) seeks applications to optimize instrumentation and device technologies for recording and modulation of neural cells and circuits, to address major challenges and to enable transformative understanding of dynamic signaling in the central nervous system. It is expected that the proposed technologies and approaches have previously demonstrated their transformative potential through initial proof-of-concept testing, and are ready for accelerated refinement through iterative engineering and end-user feedback, appropriate for a path towards sustainable dissemination and user-friendly incorporation into routine neuroscience research. Applications may propose development of instrumentation hardware and/or devices and associated software. Approaches may utilize any modality such as optical, electrical, magnetic, or acoustic recording/manipulation, to target neuronal electrical signals or other forms of neural activity, including intracellular signaling and engagement of non-neuronal cells in circuit function. This NOFO is a re-issue of RFA-NS-21-027, but unlike the previous NOFO the focus is narrowed to technologies associated with recording/manipulation instrumentation and devices, and excludes projects primarily focused on development of molecular reagents. Potential applicants primarily optimizing molecular constructs should consider RFA-MH-22-245 (or its reissue), BRAIN Initiative: Engineering and optimization of molecular technologies for functional dissection of neural circuits (UM1 Clinical Trial Not Allowed). For projects at an earlier stage of development of molecular reagents, potential applicants should consider the companion FOA (RFA-NS-25-018) or alternative BRAIN Initiative announcements including RFA-MH-21-175 and RFA-EY-21-001 (or their reissues). For this and the companion NOFO, the aim of the proposed technologies should be to reduce major barriers to conducting neurobiological experiments, including considerations of cost and ease of access, and to enable new discoveries for understanding neural circuit function. Technologies should address major challenges associated with recording and modulating CNS activity, at cellular or circuit resolution, and should contribute to an overall ecosystem of technologies spanning multiple spatial and temporal scales in any region throughout the CNS. The approaches should be compatible with experiments in behaving animals, with an expectation that they will be validated with in vivo experiments during the course of the project. Proposed validation experiments must focus on demonstrating the capabilities and potential impact of the technology, rather than advancing the state of biological knowledge as the primary project goal. Applications are encouraged to integrate multiple approaches, and where appropriate, to leverage a variety of domains of expertise from biological, chemical, and physical sciences, engineering, computational modeling, and statistical analysis.",

In addition, applicants will collaborate with NIH-funded consultants and can augment their project with NIH contract research organizations (CROs) that specialize in medicinal chemistry, pharmacokinetics, toxicology, formulations development, chemical synthesis including under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and Phase I clinical testing. Projects can enter either at the Discovery stage, to optimize promising hit compounds through medicinal chemistry to the Development stage, to advance a single development candidate through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing. Alternatively, projects can enter at the Development stage and progress in a shorter period to IND enabling toxicology studies and phase I clinical testing. BPN awardee Institutions retain their assignment of IP rights and gain assignment of IP rights from the BPN contractors (and thereby control the patent prosecution and licensing negotiations) for drug candidates developed in this program.",

Reagents will be initially developed in pilot resource projects for brain cell type-specific access and manipulation across vertebrate species from the BRAIN Initiative Armamentarium project. Awardees under this NOFO will work with the other Armamentarium awardees to manufacture and distribute the resources for use throughout the neuroscience community. It is envisioned that the awardees will work both with the Armamentarium community as well as with the neuroscience research community to optimize the use of new reagents. The types of reagents to be produced and distributed could include but are not limited to viral vectors, nucleic acid constructs, and nanoparticles designed for selective access to and manipulation of brain cell types. Such reagents will enable neuroscientists to probe circuit function with high precision in experimental animals and ex vivo human tissue and cells. Facilities are needed to contribute to the production and distribution of BRAIN Initiative Armamentarium project reagents broadly to neuroscience users.",

This FOA will support investigator-initiated research for both analytical, and clinical validation of assays to be used in cancer treatment, control, or prevention trials supported by the NCI. This NOFO will also support the validation of pharmacodynamic markers and markers of toxicity. Applicants should have assays that work on human samples and whose importance is well justified for development into clinical assays. As chemotherapies and/or radiation therapies are increasingly combined with immunotherapies to enhance the durability of anti-cancer responses, assays for measuring multiple markers, including immune markers, can be developed and validated simultaneously. The UH2 phase of this NOFO supports analytical validation of assays for these molecular/cellular/imaging markers, which must be achieved within 2 years before assays may undergo clinical validation. The UH3 phase of this NOFO supports clinical validation of analytically validated assays for up to 3 years using well-annotated biospecimens from retrospective or prospective clinical trials or studies. This NOFO may be used to validate existing assays for use in other cancer clinical trials, observational studies, or population studies. Efforts to harmonize clinical laboratory tests, including investigation into the performance and reproducibility of assays across multiple clinical laboratories, are also appropriate for this funding opportunity. Projects proposed for this NOFO will require multi-disciplinary collaboration among scientific investigators, oncologists, statisticians, and clinical laboratory scientist.",

AGENCY OVERVIEW The Advanced Research Projects Agency &#8211; Energy (ARPA-E), an organization within the Department of Energy (DOE), is chartered by Congress in the America COMPETES Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-69), as amended by the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-358), as further amended by the Energy Act of 2020 (P.L. 116-260): &#8220;(A) to enhance the economic and energy security of the United States through the development of energy technologies that&#8212; (i) reduce imports of energy from foreign sources; (ii) reduce energy-related emissions, including greenhouse gases; (iii) improve the energy efficiency of all economic sectors; (iv) provide transformative solutions to improve the management, clean-up, and disposal of radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel; and (v) improve the resilience, reliability, and security of infrastructure to produce, deliver, and store energy; and (B) to ensure that the United States maintains a technological lead in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies.&#8221; ARPA-E issues this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) under its authorizing statute codified at 42 U.S.C. &#167; 16538. The NOFO and any cooperative agreements or grants made under this NOFO are subject to 2 C.F.R. Part 200 as supplemented by 2 C.F.R. Part 910. ARPA-E funds research on, and the development of, transformative science and technology solutions to address the energy and environmental missions of the Department. The agency focuses on technologies that can be meaningfully advanced with a modest investment over a defined period of time in order to catalyze the translation from scientific discovery to early-stage technology. For the latest news and information about ARPA-E, its programs and the research projects currently supported, see: http://arpa-e.energy.gov/. ARPA-E funds transformational research. Existing energy technologies generally progress on established &#8220;learning curves&#8221; where refinements to a technology and the economies of scale that accrue as manufacturing and distribution develop drive improvements to the cost/performance metric in a gradual fashion. This continual improvement of a technology is important to its increased commercial deployment and is appropriately the focus of the private sector or the applied technology offices within DOE. In contrast, ARPA-E supports transformative research that has the potential to create fundamentally new learning curves. ARPA-E technology projects typically start with cost/performance estimates well above the level of an incumbent technology. Given the high risk inherent in these projects, many will fail to progress, but some may succeed in generating a new learning curve with a projected cost/performance metric that is significantly better than that of the incumbent technology. ARPA-E will provide support at the highest funding level only for submissions with significant technology risk, aggressive timetables, and careful management and mitigation of the associated risks. ARPA-E funds technology with the potential to be disruptive in the marketplace. The mere creation of a new learning curve does not ensure market penetration. Rather, the ultimate value of a technology is determined by the marketplace, and impactful technologies ultimately become disruptive &#8211; that is, they are widely adopted and displace existing technologies from the marketplace or create entirely new markets. ARPA-E understands that definitive proof of market disruption takes time, particularly for energy technologies. Therefore, ARPA-E funds the development of technologies that, if technically successful, have clear disruptive potential, e.g., by demonstrating capability for manufacturing at competitive cost and deployment at scale. ARPA-E funds applied research and development (R&amp;D). The Office of Management and Budget defines &#8220;applied research&#8221; as an &#8220;original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge&#8230;directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective&#8221; and defines &#8220;experimental development&#8221; as &#8220;creative and systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience, which is directed at producing new products or processes or improving existing products or processes.&#8221;0F1 Applicants interested in receiving financial assistance for basic research (defined by the Office of Management and Budget as &#8220;experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts&#8221;)1 should contact the DOE&#8217;s Office of Science (http://science.energy.gov/). Office of Science national scientific user facilities (http://science.energy.gov/user-facilities/) are open to all researchers, including ARPA-E Applicants and awardees. These facilities provide advanced tools of modern science including accelerators, colliders, supercomputers, light sources and neutron sources, as well as facilities for studying the nanoworld, the environment, and the atmosphere. Projects focused on early-stage R&amp;D for the improvement of technology along defined roadmaps may be more appropriate for support through the DOE applied energy offices including: the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (http://www.eere.energy.gov/), the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (https://www.energy.gov/fecm/office-fossil-energy-and-carbon-management), the Office of Nuclear Energy (http://www.energy.gov/ne/office-nuclear-energy), and the Office of Electricity (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity). ARPA-E encourages submissions stemming from ideas that still require proof-of-concept R&amp;D efforts as well as those for which some proof-of-concept demonstration already exists. Submissions can propose a project with the end deliverable being an extremely creative, but partial solution. PROGRAM OVERVIEW The Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy technologies with Untapped Potential (SCALEUP) Ready program provides a vital mechanism for the support of innovative energy R&amp;D that complements ARPA-E&#8217;s primary focus on early-stage transformational energy technologies that require proof of concept. Technologies that achieve substantial technical advancement under ARPA-E support may still face significant technical and commercial challenges upon completion of an award&apos;s funding period, and thus are at risk of being stranded in their development path once ARPA-E funding ends. Experience across ARPA-E&#8217;s diverse energy portfolios, and input from a wide range of investors and industry stakeholders, indicate that pre-commercial scaling projects are critical to establish practical performance and cost parameters. These pre-commercial scaling projects aim to 1) translate the performance achieved at bench scale to commercially scalable versions of the technology, 2) integrate the technology with broader systems, 3) provide extended performance data, and 4) validate the manufacturability and reliability of new energy technologies. Successful scaling projects should enable industry stakeholders to justify the substantial commitments of financial resources, personnel, manufacturing facilities, and materials necessary to subsequently deploy the technologies at a commercial scale. SCALEUP Ready seeks to scale the most promising technologies previously funded by ARPA-E. The possibility of ARPA-E-funded technologies becoming stranded along their development pathways leaves substantial intellectual property developed with American taxpayer dollars vulnerable to adoption by foreign competitors, who capture it for continued development and economic benefit overseas. This harms national competitiveness, as U.S. industries often fall behind on the development, scaling, and manufacturing of technologies necessary to compete in rapidly evolving global energy markets. Thus, projects selected for SCALEUP Ready will meet ARPA-E&#8217;s statutory goals by &#8220;accelerating transformational technological advances in areas that industry by itself is not likely to undertake because of technical and financial uncertainty.&quot;",

        "description": "The primary objective of the Cultural Anthropology Program is to support fundamental, systematic anthropological research and training to increase understanding of the causes, consequences and complexities of human social and cultural variability. The Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals from researchers in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology and research at any temporal or spatial scale. Methodologies and approaches employed may include ethnographic field research, surveys, remote sensing, the collection of bio-markers, experimental research inside or outside of laboratory settings, archival research, the analysis of materials collections and extant data bases, mathematical and computational modeling and other research tools as appropriate for the proposed research. The overarching research goals should be to produce empirically grounded findings that will be generalizable beyond particular case studies and contribute to building a more robust anthropological science of human society and culture. The U.S. National Science Foundation&apos;s mandate is to support basic scientific research. Basic research in cultural anthropology means theory-generating and theory-testing research that creates new knowledge about human culture and society. Therefore, the Cultural Anthropology Program cannot support research that takes as its primary objective improved clinical practice, applied policy or other immediate application. Research that seeks to advance scientific cultural anthropological theories in a way that advances use-inspired objectives may be supported, but the theory-advancing objectives must be clearly at the center of the proposal. A proposal to use anthropological methods and approaches only to find solutions to social, medical or other problems without specifically proposing to make a theory-testing or theory-expanding contribution to anthropological science will be returned without review.",

This NOFO will also support the validation of pharmacodynamic markers and markers of toxicity. Applicants to this NOFO must have an assay(s) whose performance has been analytically validated in specimens similar to those for the intended clinical use of the marker(s) and assay(s). As chemotherapies and/or radiation therapies are increasingly combined with immunotherapies to enhance the durability of anti-cancer responses, assays for measuring multiple markers, including immune markers, can be developed and validated simultaneously. The UH3 mechanism will support the clinical validation of established assays for up to 3 years using specimens from retrospective or prospective clinical trials or studies. This NOFO may be used to validate existing assays for use in other trials, observational studies, or population studies. Efforts to harmonize clinical laboratory tests, including investigation into the performance and reproducibility of assays across multiple clinical laboratories, are also appropriate for this funding opportunity. Projects proposed for this NOFO will require multi-disciplinary interaction and collaboration among scientific investigators, oncologists, statisticians, and clinical laboratory scientists. This NOFO is not intended to support early-stage development of technology or the conduct of clinical trials but is intended for validation of assays to the point where they could be integrated into clinical trials/studies as investigational assays.",

It cannot be used for thesis or dissertation research. The research must be focused on one or more of the areas within the biomedical and behavioral scientific mission of the NIDCD: hearing, balance, smell, taste, voice, speech, or language. The NIDCD ECR Award R21 grant mechanism supports different types of projects including secondary analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; development of research methodology; translational research; outcomes research; and development of new research technology. Irrespective of the type of project, the intent of the NIDCD ECR Award R21 is for the Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) (PD(s)/PI(s)) to obtain sufficient preliminary data for a subsequent R01 application.",

Conversely, there is a benefit in understanding circumstances that create a need to stop or reduce (de-implement) the use of practices that are ineffective, unproven, low-value, or harmful. In addition, studies to advance dissemination and implementation research methods and measures are encouraged. Applications that focus on re-implementation of evidence-based health services that may be disrupted amidst disasters (e.g., pandemics) remain relevant.

In this pilot phase of effectiveness research, the trial should be designed to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety, and potential effectiveness of the approach; to address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanisms(s) that is/are presumed to underlie the intervention effects; and to obtain preliminary data needed as a pre-requisite to a larger-scale effectiveness trial (e.g., comparative effectiveness study, practical trial) designed to definitely test the effectiveness of interventions to improve post-acute outcomes. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) supports pilot effectiveness research to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, acceptability, safety and preliminary indications of effectiveness of post-acute phase intervention approaches and inform the design of definitive effectiveness trials.

        "description": "The purpose of this announcement is to encourage investigators to pursue a small clinical trial to obtain critical information necessary to advance recording and/or stimulating devices to treat central nervous system disorders and better understand the human brain (e.g., Early Feasibility Study). Clinical studies supported may consist of acute or short-term procedures that are deemed Non-Significant Risk (NSR) by an Institutional Review Board (IRB), or Significant Risk (SR) studies that require an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA, such as chronic implants. The clinical trial should provide data to answer key questions about the function or final design of a device. This final device design may require most, if not all, of the non-clinical testing on the path to more advanced clinical trials and market approval. The clinical trial is expected to provide information that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use. Activities supported by this Funding Opportunity include a small clinical trial to answer key questions about the function or final design of a device.As part of the BRAIN Initiative, NIH has initiated a Public-Private Partnership Program (BRAIN PPP) that includes agreements (Memoranda of Understanding, MOU) with a number of device manufacturers willing to make such devices available, including devices and capabilities not yet market approved but appropriate for clinical research. In general it is expected that the devices&apos; existing safety and utility data will be sufficient to enable new IRB NSR or FDA IDE approval without need for significant additional non-clinical data. For more information on the BRAIN PPP, see http://braininitiative.nih.gov/BRAIN_PPP/index.htm",

Specifically, the focus of this FOA is on the identification and initial biological, analytical and clinical evaluation of biomarkers and biomarker signatures for neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Although research supported by this FOA can include animal studies, it must also include preliminary human evaluation using carefully standardized human samples or datasets. The goal of this initiative is to deliver candidate biomarkers or biomarker signatures that are ready for definitive analytical and clinical validation studies.",

Activities supported in this program include implementation of clinical prototype devices, non-clinical safety and efficacy testing, design verification and validation activities, obtaining an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) for a Significant Risk (SR) study or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) study, as well as a subsequent small clinical study. The clinical study is expected to provide information about the device function or final design that cannot be practically obtained through additional non-clinical assessments (e.g., bench top or animal studies) due to the novelty of the device or its intended use. This NOFO is a milestone-driven cooperative agreement program and will involve participation of NIH program staff in negotiating the final project plan before award and monitoring of research progress.",

Large quantities of genomic data collected from pediatric congenital anomalies cohorts are available to the research community through several databases such as the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Portal, the European Genome-Phenome Archive and Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen). The purpose of this initiative is to promote the screening, functional validation and characterization of congenital anomaly-associated genetic variants identified through public facing databases and individual efforts using in-silico tools, appropriate animal models, in vitro systems or multi-pronged approaches. This initiative addresses a challenging gap between identifying sequence variations of potential interest and recognizing which of those variations have functional effects on the phenotype of interest.",

Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns, improving trial design and knowledge of trial feasibility and thus saving NCI time and money.",

Specifically, this NOFO solicits applications that will characterize person-specific features affecting probiotic responses to identify subgroups of probiotic responders and to enhance probiotic clinical outcomes. The ultimate goal of this NOFO is to identify, understand, and develop strategies to address barriers in precision probiotic therapies to account for the heterogenicity in humans that causes inconsistent probiotic responses. The first phase, funded by the R61, will providing for up to 2 years to identify unique host biological patterns (e.g., native microbiome, immune system, gender, diet, age, genetic background, lifestyle, and health history) that are correlated with heterogeneity of probiotic clinical effects using observational or secondary data analysis studies. The second phase, funded under the R33, will support studies to assess the ability of the unique patterns determined in the R61 phase to detect the improvement of probiotic responsiveness in rigorously designed mechanistic studies in relevant animal models or in human subjects. The combined R61/R33 should not exceed 5 years. Transition from the R61 to the R33 phase of the award will be administratively reviewed and will be determined based on successful completion of Transition Milestones that need to be clearly specified in the R61 phase application. Support for a single phased award that does not need the R61 Exploratory phase is available in the companion (R33) NOFO, PAR-AT-24-XXX (TEMP-25413).",

This NOFO will solicit applied research in support of NASA&#8217;s Human Research Program (HRP). This NOFO is available through the the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) at: https://tinyurl.com/HERO25NOFO. The research will fall into one or more categories corresponding to HRP&#8217;s five Elements: Space Radiation, Human Health Countermeasures, Exploration Medical Capability, Human Factors and Behavioral Performance, and Research Operations and Integration. This NOFO covers all aspects of research to provide human health and performance countermeasures, knowledge, technologies, and tools to enable safe, reliable, and productive human space exploration. Awards generally range from under $250K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to $1.2M per year for extensive activities (e.g., development of scientific hardware) and will be made as grants. The funds available for awards in each research opportunity offered in this NOFO range from less than one million to several million dollars. This range allows selection from a few to as many as a dozen proposals depending on the program objectives and the submission of proposals of merit. The period of performance for an award can range from one to five years. [g1] Any changes or modifications to any of these guidelines will be specified in the descriptions of the relevant research opportunities in the appendices of this solicitation. Details of the topics will be given in the appendices of the NOFO. Unless otherwise specified, appendices will use a two-step solicitation process requiring that a compliant and relevant Step-1 proposal be submitted in order to be considered to be invited to submit a Step-2 proposal. Proposal due dates will be staggered throughout the HERO open period of November 1, 2024 to October 2025. The first proposal due date (for Step-1 proposals submitted in response to Appendix A) is December 2, 2024. The electronic submission is required by the due date for proposal submission. Proposal due dates are given in the appendices, which will be posted at https://nspires.nasaprs.com. Interested proposers should monitor https://nspires.nasaprs.com or register and subscribe to the Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD) electronic notifications system through the NSPIRES account subscription services. New program elements or amendments to this NOFO through October 2025 will be posted in NSPIRES, after which time release of a subsequent HERO NOFO is planned. All categories of United States (U.S.) institutions are eligible to submit proposals in response to the NOFO. Principal Investigators may collaborate with universities, Federal Government laboratories, the private sector, and state and local government laboratories. In all such arrangements, the applying entity is expected to be responsible for administering the project according to the management approach presented in the proposal. NASA&#8217;s policy is to conduct research with non-U.S. organizations on a cooperative, no exchange-of-funds basis. Thank you for your continued interest in NASA.

Although the scientific literature or preliminary data may provide the rationale for conducting a clinical trial, investigators often lack critical information about the study population, accrual challenges, intervention, outcome/ endpoints, data/statistical challenges or operational risks necessary to finalize the trial protocol completely. These information gaps can result in multiple protocol changes before and after trial start-up, leading to the need for additional time and expenses that may prevent study completion. Further, the suitability and feasibility of new trial designs, which minimize infrastructure and reduce costs may need to be tested in the context of a particular intervention, at-risk group, symptom or venue. Preparatory studies may fill information gaps and address unknowns, improving trial design and knowledge of trial feasibility and thus saving NCI time and money.",

        "description": "The objective of the Human-Environment and Geographical Sciences Program is to support basic scientific research about the nature, causes, consequences, or evolution of the spatial dimensions of human behaviors, activities, and dynamics as well as their interactions with environmental and social processes across a range of scales. Contemporary geographical research encompasses diverse research traditions and methodologies. Recognizing the breadth of the field&#8217;s contributions to science, the HEGS Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, theoretically engaged, methodologically rigorous, and generalizable research that advances geographical and geospatial sciences. Because the National Science Foundation&apos;s mandate is to support fundamental scientific research, the HEGS program cannot fund research that takes as its primary goal humanistic interpretations or findings that are not generalizable or reproducible.&#8239;HEGS welcomes proposals that utilize quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods in novel ways.&#8239;However, a proposal that applies geographical or geospatial methods to a geographic problem&#8239;without proposing how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing or theory-expanding contribution to geographical science, broadly defined, will be returned without review.&#8239;HEGS supported projects are expected to yield results that will enhance, expand, and transform fundamental geographical theory and geospatial methods and that will have broader impacts that benefit society. Generally, successful HEGS proposals should describe clear and detailed plans for data collection (including sample selection if appropriate), justification for proposed methods, plans for data analysis, attention to confounding variables, and efforts to address biases (e.g., confirmatory biases, selection biases, etc.). Competitive HEGS proposals should substantiate the validity of findings and generalizability to broader contexts. It should be noted that HEGS is situated in the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division of the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate at NSF. Therefore, it is critical that research projects submitted to the HEGS program illustrate how the proposed research questions engage human dimensions that are relevant and important to people and societies. A proposal that fails to be responsive to these program expectations will be returned without review. ",

The motivation for this initiative is that much of current imaging research into the role of inflammation in cancer is largely based on in vitro and ex vivo methods with limited utilization of imaging approaches that could lead to significant new insights relevant to dynamic cancer and inflammation interactions. Utilization of molecular imaging probes in pre-clinical and clinical investigations for precise temporal resolution at the molecular and cellular level are valuable approaches for identification and characterization of in vivo inflammatory cellular physiology in cancers and of molecular changes in response to treatment. This FOA encourages applications that focus on developing integrated imaging approaches to interrogate the role of inflammation in cancer through strong cross-field collaboration between cancer basic science researchers and imaging scientists. These collaborations are expected to advance science and understanding of cancer inflammation interactions.",

The NOFO is intended to support discovery research for the identification of validated hits relevant to health-related outcomes of participating NIH Institutes. Stages of discovery research covered by this NOFO include: 1) assay development for specific biological targets and disease mechanisms relevant to the mission of participating NIH Institutes with the intent to screen for small molecule compounds that show potential as probes for use in advancing knowledge about the known targets, identifying new targets, or as pre-therapeutic leads; 2) screen implementation high throughput target-focused approaches or moderate throughput phenotypic- and fragment-based approaches to identify initial screening hits; 3) hit validation, including implementation of secondary assays that are orthogonal to the primary assay, advanced cheminformatics analysis and initial medicinal chemistry inspection to prioritize the hit set, and follow-up assays to characterize mode and mechanism of action of the validated hits; 4) hit-to-lead optimization, including SAR to optimize target engagement, selectivity and to minimize chemical liabilities, ADME, PK and PD studies, and, if appropriate, in vivo modeling to test efficacy or biological effects.",

The mission of IMPC is to generate a comprehensive catalogue of mammalian gene function that will provide the foundation for functional analyses of human genetic variation. The current (July 19, 2022) IMPC data release includes phenotypic data for 8260 knockout genes. Overall, the IMPC hopes to generate a null mutant and undertake broad-based phenotyping for every gene in the mouse genome. About 30% of these strains are expected to be either embryonic or perinatal lethal, or subviable. However, a large portion of homozygous lethal mutations are expected to have viable heterozygous phenotypes. The scientific community has the unique opportunity to leverage these mouse strains while they are being created and bred as part of the IMPC adult mouse phenotyping effort to perform additional in-depth phenotyping and research.",

A comprehensive understanding of the natural history of a condition is necessary to facilitate appropriate interventions for infants identified by newborn screening. Characterization of the sequence and timing of symptom development provides information crucial for developing targeted, age-appropriate treatments and for establishing a baseline against which to assess novel interventions. In addition, for some conditions, establishment of genotype-phenotype correlations may facilitate prediction of the clinical course; for others, identification of modifying genetic, epigenetic, or environmental factors may enhance understanding of clinical outcomes. Comprehensive data on the natural history of a condition will facilitate the fields ability to: 1) identify the underlying biological mechanisms; 2) understand the genetic and clinical heterogeneity and phenotypic expression of the condition; 3) improve diagnostic accuracy; 4) facilitate clinical trials by providing comprehensive natural history data; 5) prevent, manage, and treat symptoms and complications of the condition; 6) furnish physicians and families with needed support and predictive information about the condition; and 7) establish data collection systems or patient registries to collect longitudinal data (e.g., child/family outcomes following newborn screening).",

        "description": "The U.S. Embassy Sofia Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) of the U.S. Department of State is pleased to announce that funding is available through its Public Diplomacy Small Grants Program. This is an Annual Program Statement, outlining our funding priorities, the strategic themes we focus on, and the procedures for submitting requests for funding. Please carefully follow all instructions below. Small Grants Program Goals and Objectives: PDS Sofia invites proposals for programs that align with U.S. administration objectives to make the U.S. safer, stronger, and more prosperous and comply with all Executive Orders. All programs must include a U.S. element, or clear connection with American expert/s, organization/s, or institution/s in a specific field that will promote these priorities. Priority Program Areas: Competitive proposals should focus on one or more of the following areas: &#183; Programs showcasing American leadership and innovation&#8212;teaching U.S. best practices/achievements in entrepreneurship, financial literacy, science, technology, energy, and cybersecurity to secondary and university students, especially from regions outside major cities. &#183; Programs that celebrate American culture, scientific advances, and innovation ahead of America&#8217;s 250th anniversary. &#183; Programs that increase English language proficiency, unlocking economic opportunities, increasing understanding of U.S. policy priorities, and establishing an environment for even stronger future cooperation. &#183; Programs that build active, sustainable networks of alumni from U.S. exchange programs or U.S. educational institutions who understand U.S. and Bulgarian shared priorities and advocate for them within their local communities. &#183; Programs that forge partnerships between U.S. and Bulgarian educational, cultural, or civic society organizations/institutions, including the development of joint- degree programs, internships, trainings or exchanges, in strategic areas like energy security/cooperation, cybersecurity, biotechnology, AI, etc. &#183; Programs that foster closer people-to-people ties between Bulgarians and other U.S. allies/neighbors in the region&#8212;increasing trust and promoting regional economic and security self-sufficiency. &#183; Programs that increase interest in and opportunities for Bulgarians to study in the United States and Americans to study in Bulgaria. &#183; Programs that promote the protection of intellectual property (IP) rights, enabling an environment for creative innovation and incentivizing new investments. &#183; Programs that ensure accurate local media coverage of U.S. priorities/policies to audiences most susceptible to foreign propaganda; or programs that increase awareness of foreign actors&#8217; efforts to undermine U.S. interests. Deadlines and Funding Decisions: Proposals will be evaluated on a rolling basis based on the availability of funds. However, the final deadline for FY 25 proposals will be 5:00 p.m. Sofia time on July 25, 2025. We recommend submitting proposals when ready and not waiting until the July 25 deadline as funding may be depleted by then. No exceptions will be given for late or incomplete proposals. Note: see Submission Dates and Times in Part D below for more specific information. Whenever possible, applicants should submit proposals for projects at least 2-3 months prior to anticipated program start dates. PDS Sofia is generally unable to approve/fund proposals that are submitted last minute and are slated to begin 1-1.5 months after they are submitted. Please carefully review the full text of the Annual Program Statement in the Related Documents section.",

This is an Annual Program Statement, outlining our funding priorities, the strategic themes we focus on, and the procedures for submitting requests for funding. Please carefully follow all instructions below. Funding Instrument Type: Grant, fixed amount award (FAA), or cooperative agreement. Cooperative agreements and some FAAs are different from grants in that U.S. Embassy Harare staff are more actively involved in the grant implementation (&#8220;Substantial Involvement&#8221;). Program Performance Period: Proposed projects should be completed in 18 months or less. The Department of State will rarely entertain applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the initial budget period. If selected, the application can be processed on a non-competitive basis subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the program, and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the U.S. Department of State. This notice is subject to availability of funding. Priority Region: Zimbabwe Executive Summary PD Harare invites proposals for projects that strengthen networks between the people of the United States and the people of Zimbabwe through exchanges highlighting our shared goals and values. All programs MUST include an American component, such as an American expert engagement (physical or virtual) in Zimbabwe or Zimbabweans traveling to the United States to collaborate and exchange best practices in a specific field that will promote increased understanding of U.S. perspectives.

Other Direct Costs: Describe other costs directly associated with the program, which do not fit in the other categories. For example, shipping costs for materials and equipment or applicable taxes. All &#8220;Other&#8221; or &#8220;Miscellaneous&#8221; expenses must be itemized and explained. Indirect Costs: These are costs that cannot be linked directly to the program activities, such as overhead costs needed to help keep the organization operating. If your organization has a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate (NICRA) and includes NICRA charges in the budget, attach a copy of your latest NICRA. Organizations that have never had a NICRA may request indirect costs of 15% of Modified Total Direct Costs as defined in 2 CFR 200.1. &#8220;Cost Sharing&#8221; refers to contributions from the organization or other entities other than the U.S. Embassy. It also includes in-kind contributions such as volunteers&#8217; time and donated venues. Alcoholic Beverages: Please note that award funds cannot be used for alcoholic beverages. &#183; ",

        "description": "This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages research on the biology of high confidence risk factors associated with complex brain disorders, with a focus on the intracellular, transcellular and circuit substrates of neural function. For the purposes of this NOFO, the term complex can refer to a multifactorial contribution to risk (e.g., polygenic and/or environmental) and/or highly distributed functional features of the brain disorder. Studies may be either hypothesis-generating (unbiased discovery) or hypothesis-testing in design and may utilize in vivo, in situ, or in vitro experimental paradigms, e.g., model organisms or human cell-based assays. While behavioral paradigms and outcome measures can be incorporated into the research design to facilitate the characterization of intracellular, transcellular and circuit mechanisms, these are neither required nor expected. Studies should not attempt to model disorders but instead should aim to elucidate the neurobiological impact of individual or combined risk factor(s), such as the affected molecular and cellular components and their relationships within defined biological process(es). This can include the fundamental biology of these factors, components and processes. The resulting paradigms, component pathways and biological processes should be disseminated with sufficient detail to enrich common and/or federated data resources (e.g., those contributing to the Gene Ontology, Synaptic Gene Ontology, FAIR Data Informatics) in order to bridge the gap between disease risk factors, biological mechanism and therapeutic target identification. The present NOFO (R21 activity code) can be used for applications to develop early stage, high-risk, exploratory approaches or establish proof-of-concept where there is little or no preliminary data. Applicants proposing to develop lines of inquiry where feasibility or proof of concept has been established should apply to the companion R01 NOFO (PAR-xx-xxx).",

Kids First has established and continues to develop a Data Resource including a collection of curated genomic and phenotypic data from childhood cancer and structural birth defects cohorts and a central portal where these data and analysis tools are accessible to the research community. Access to these data will promote comprehensive and cross-cutting research and collaboration leading to more refined diagnostic capabilities and ultimately more targeted therapies. This NOFO is intended to support meritorious small research projects focused on analyses of childhood cancer and/or structural birth defects genomic datasets generated by the Kids First program and/or associated phenotypic datasets. Development of approaches, tools, or algorithms appropriate for analyzing genomic, phenotypic, and/or clinical data relevant to Kids First may also be proposed.",

ORIP seeks to enhance the ability of ORIP SERCA K01 awardees to conduct research as they transition to fully independent investigator status. The R03 mechanism supports projects including pilot and feasibility studies; secondary analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; development of research methodology; and development of new research technology. The R03 is intended to support research projects that can realistically be completed in two years and that require limited levels of funding. This Funding Opportunity Announcement does not accept applications proposing clinical trial(s).",

        "description": "This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) encourages applications for investigator-initiated, early phase, clinical trials of natural products (i.e., botanicals, probiotics, and products marketed as dietary supplements), which have a strong scientific premise to justify further clinical testing. For this NOFO, natural products include promising nutritional regimens that standardize the amount of a specific naturally occurring nutritional compound (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, anthocyanidins, or polyphenols) and have compelling preliminary evidence. Under this NOFO, trials must be designed so that results, whether positive or negative, will provide information of high scientific utility and will support decisions about further development or testing of the natural product. This NOFO will provide up to three years (R61 phase) of support for milestone-driven testing of pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and assessment of the natural products effect (i.e., measure of mechanism of action) when used by humans on a specified target measure. If milestones in the R61 phase are achieved, up to 3 years of additional support (R33 phase) may be awarded to replicate the impact of the natural product on target engagement(s) when used by humans and assess whether there is an association between the degree of the impact on the target engagement and clinical outcomes in a participant population. Applications are encouraged to design R33 studies to determine how to optimize the impact of the natural product on the target engagement by optimizing the delivery of the natural product through examination of different doses or formulations. In addition, applications can be designed to combine the natural product with another treatment approach that is known to impact the same target engagement measure; or study the impact of the natural product in a population that is more responsive,",

Data analysis for each project can be performed using existing and/or novel methods to be developed in the proposed project(s), including methods for data and metadata mining, data integration, and Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML)/Deep Learning (DL) methods. In addition to analysis of existing data, experimental or in silico work is required to validate the results of the proposed analysis , or to validate a newly developed analytic method. Projects aimed at understanding oral health disparities to inform strategies for improving health for all individuals are a priority. Projects focused on investigating and/or characterizing human biological pathways to inform identification of intervention targets or defining the pathogenicity of known genetic variants are encouraged.",

This gap is increased by the barriers associated with technologies under development for small commercial markets, such as those focused on rare diseases or young pediatric populations. This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites small businesses to submit SBIR grant applications to support later stage research and development (referred to as Phase IIB) for promising projects that were previously funded by SBIR or STTR (Small Business Technology Transfer) Phase II awards that address rare diseases or young pediatric populations (aged 0-12 years and defined in Section IV, part 7), and will require eventual Federal regulatory approval/clearance. The goal of this NOFO and the resulting Phase IIB awards is to assist applicants in pursuing the next appropriate milestone(s) necessary to advance a product to regulatory approval and commercialization by promoting partnerships between small business awardees and third-party investors and/or strategic partners, including patient advocacy organizations.

Bladder cancer is a significant health problem both in the United States and globally. Because of the high incidence and frequent tumor recurrence, bladder cancer exacts an outsized medical burden. While recent progress has been made in the molecular profiling of bladder cancers and identification of mutated genes, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms driving initiation, progression, and malignancy of bladder cancer. Furthermore, our understanding of biological processes of the normal bladder at the molecular, cell and organ levels is limited. Fundamental knowledge of how molecular and cellular functions of the bladder are altered in cancer will aid our understanding of bladder cancer biology and interventions.

        "description": "Through this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), the National Cancer Institute (NCI) solicits applications investigating the biology and underlying mechanisms of bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is a significant health problem both in the United States and globally. Because of the high incidence and frequent tumor recurrence, bladder cancer exacts an outsized medical burden. While recent progress has been made in the molecular profiling of bladder cancers and identification of mutated genes, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms driving initiation, progression, and malignancy of bladder cancer. Furthermore, our understanding of biological processes of the normal bladder at the molecular, cell and organ levels is limited. Fundamental knowledge of how molecular and cellular functions of the bladder are altered in cancer will aid our understanding of bladder cancer biology and interventions. Applications that involve multidisciplinary teams and use clinical specimens or investigate both normal and cancer processes are encouraged.",

The Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) will support efforts to optimize and evaluate measures of neurophysiological processes that are disrupted within or across mental disorders in both healthy humans and in another species relevant to the therapeutic development pipeline. The initiative will support initial proof of concept studies aimed at identifying measures for potential development as preclinical assays for evaluating potential new drug and device therapies and their targets. Data will also reveal assay measures where the performance between preclinical animal species and humans is dissimilar, thus establishing a firm basis for limiting speculative extrapolations of preclinical animal findings to humans. The ultimate practical goal of this NOFO is to improve the efficiency of the therapeutic development process by identifying coherence of measures and inconsistencies between the preclinical screening pipeline and clinical evaluation of new treatment candidates and thereby hasten the development of more effective treatments for mental disorders.",

NCCIH expects that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned future clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R34) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent competitive full-scale clinical trial. Under this R34, the data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge necessary to develop a competitive full-scale clinical trial, including, but not limited to the following: examining feasibility and acceptability of interventions lacking published data; tailoring or adapting the content or structure of an intervention to a specific population, modality, or setting; refining the intervention to determine the most appropriate frequency or duration; determining feasibility of recruitment, retention, and data collection procedures; refining and assessing the feasibility of protocolized multi-component interventions; or examining acceptability and adherence of control conditions.

SBIRT/P, (a term used for purposes of this funding announcement), involves screening individuals for risk of ATOD use and misuse, briefly intervening with a conversation about harmful substance use, and referring individuals for treatment or preventive services, as needed. Proposed research should include prospective tests of SBIRT/P and should leverage collaborations with healthcare and community partners. Specific research interests of participating NIH ICOs are detailed within. ",

Applications submitted under this NOFO are expected to propose a multisite feasibility clinical trial that will provide new information that is scientifically necessary for the planning and conduct of a subsequent clinical efficacy or effectiveness study, pragmatic trial, or dissemination and implementation trial within NCCIHs mission. NCCIH expects that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned future clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R01) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent fully powered, full-scale clinical trial. Under this R01, the data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge, including, but not limited to the following: assessing whether the intervention can be delivered with fidelity across sites; demonstrating feasibility of recruitment, accrual, and randomization of participants across sites; demonstrating participant adherence to the intervention, as well as retention of participants throughout the study across sites; refining and assessing the feasibility of protocolized multimodal interventions, and/or demonstrating feasibility of data collection across sites in preparation for a future fully powered, multisite efficacy or effectiveness trial. The need for multisite feasibility trials is expected to be justified by sufficient preliminary data from previous single site feasibility or acceptability trial(s) or the published literature. The data collected should be used to fill gaps in scientific knowledge and be necessary to develop a competitive fully powered multisite clinical trial that has the potential to make a significant impact on public health.",

This funding opportunity aims to advance novel and innovative translational research to better comprehend the underlying neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms of mood and psychosis disorders and related symptoms during MT. This funding opportunity also encourages interdisciplinary researchers to collaborate on studies of mood and psychosis during the MT. Aspects of mood and psychosis disorders that are of interest include: classic depressive symptoms in combination with menopause symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, night sweats, sleep disturbance) and psychological challenges, the role of reproductive steroids in the regulation of mood and behavior during the MT, diagnosis of mood and psychosis symptoms at menopausal stage, investigation of co-occurring psychiatric and menopause symptoms, appreciation of psychosocial factors common in midlife, and differential diagnoses. Review criteria will focus on the comprehensiveness of the neurobiology and mechanisms of action underlying mood and psychosis symptoms and hypothesis-driven work.",

Invasive neural recordings provide an unparalleled window into the human brain to explore the neural circuitry and neural dynamics underlying complex moods, emotions, cognitive functions, and behaviors with high spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the ability to stimulate, via the same electrodes, allows for direct causal tests by modulating network dynamics. This funding opportunity aims to target a gap in the scientific knowledge of neural circuit function related to mental health disorders. Researchers should target specific questions suited to invasive recording modalities that have high translational potential.

The overarching goal is to extend our understanding of brain development and aging, including studies of the neurodevelopmental origins of later health and disease. Research can include healthy human participants of any age, specific clinical groups such as those with cognitive, motor, or affective regulation challenges, and/or animal research on these domains of function. The studies can focus on longitudinal neuroanatomical or functional changes at any level, including genetics/genomics, single cells, connectomics, neural population activity patterns, and others. This funding opportunity is intended to encourage technological and conceptual innovation to improve repeated measures across longer epochs of the lifespan, to better predict outcomes at later ages.",

This includes integration of effective prevention and treatment interventions with an understanding of the overarching framework for reducing the incidence of new infections by facilitating cross-cutting informative research. This R34 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) supports studies that are both necessary and sufficient to inform the planning of a clinical trial within the scope of the companion announcement HIV Prevention and Alcohol (R01 Clinical Trials Optional). The NIAAA expects that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R34) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent trial. Furthermore, this NOFO will support research projects that are designed to provide results that will be sufficient to inform the future trial without further studies. The planned Phase II, III, or IV trial must be primarily intended to test the efficacy, safety, clinical management, or implementation of intervention(s) in the prevention of HIV. In this NIAAA funding opportunity for pilot clinical trials the R34 mechanism is intended to provide new information that answers a scientific or operational question(s) which may be pragmatic in nature and, therefore, informs the final development of a clinical trial and testing of intervention tools.",

This NOFO is intended to support trials that: address a significant problem, such that the findings have potential to inform practice; are adequately powered to definitively answer the primary research question(s), with well-justified hypotheses supported by pilot data; and are designed to examine questions regarding mediators and moderators of effects. Consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, this NOFO is intended to support effectiveness trials that explicitly address whether the intervention engages the target(s)/mechanism(s) presumed to underlie the intervention effects (i.e., the mechanism(s) that accounts for changes in clinical/functional outcomes, changes in provider behavior, improved access or continuity of services, etc.). The collaborative R01 mechanism provides support for multisite trials when two or more sites are necessary for completion of the trial (e.g., to increase sample size, accelerate recruitment, or increase sample diversity and representation).",

The NOFO will support milestone-driven early stage trials in pediatric and adult populations. First in human (FIH) and Phase II studies of novel agents must assess target engagement (brain exposure), pharmacological effects, safety, and tolerability to assess feasibility for Phase II/proof of concept (PoC) studies in psychiatric disorders. Phase II/PoC studies must evaluate the drugs impact on clinically relevant physiological systems (functional measures) and clinical indicators of effect. The NOFO also supports FIH and early feasibility studies (EFS) of novel devices to evaluate target engagement, safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The overall objective is to facilitate rapid collection of data to &quot;de-risk&quot; novel mechanism of action investigational drugs, novel drugs for use in pediatric populations with psychiatric disorders, and devices or combination treatments in order to attract private or other public funding for further clinical development as FDA-approved treatments. A key aspect of this NOFO is the formation of collaborative partnerships between the biomedical researchers and biotechnology or industry researchers to facilitate psychiatric drug or device development.",

        "description": "This notice of funding opportunity is administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary, Interior Business Center, Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) as part of the U.S. Government Interagency Agreement between the Office of Native Hawaiian Relations (ONHR) and AQD. The Office of Native Hawaiian Relations&#8217; (ONHR) Heritage (Tourism) Opportunities in Hawaii (HOIHI) Grant Program serves to implement the Native Hawaiian Organization NATIVE Act Grants under CFDA 15.068 and the provisions of the Native American Tourism and Improving Visitor Experience Act (NATIVE Act), 25 U.S.C. 4351 et seq. The purpose of the NATIVE Act is to establish a more inclusive national travel and tourism strategy that delivers significant benefits for Native Hawaiian organizations (NHO) as distinctly defined in the NATIVE Act, including job creation, elevated living standards, and expanded economic opportunities.Tourism in Hawaii has grown with 9.4 million visitor arrivals in 2022 in a State whose population is less than 1.5 million people. This volume of visitors over a sustained period has led to depletion of natural and cultural resources, including the desecration of sites sacred to the Native Hawaiian Community, and the displacement of its members due to a lack in economic opportunities.The HOIHI Grant Program is an innovative effort to utilize Native Hawaiian traditional knowledge to bolster economic development in the Native Hawaiian Community, advance economic growth in the State of Hawaii, and to equip Native Hawaiian organizations (NHO) with the needed resources to transform tourism involving historical and sacred sites to be regenerative and collaborative. The HOIHI Grant Program seeks to increase economic development within the Native Hawaiian Community by expanding opportunities for entrepreneurship among members, increasing innovation potential on the usage and incorporation of traditional knowledge, and ultimately increasing growth of new businesses within the Community. This, in turn, broadens the ability of Native businesses to flourish and contribute to lowering unemployment and increasing expanding economic growth. HOIHI also furthers the opportunity to promote the incorporation of regenerative tourism models, and in doing so allows for the conservation and preservation of unique natural and cultural resources, and historic sites. The NATIVE Act plays an important role in promoting heritage and cultural tourism opportunities through the self-determining participation of Native American communities, including the Native Hawaiian Community, in the visitor industry. The Hawaiian value of HOIHI (to treat with reverence or respect), as reflected in the olelo noeau (Hawaiian proverb) &#8220;E hoihi aku, e hoihi mai,&#8221; meaning &#8220;show respect, get respect&#8221;, represents the core principle of ONHR&#8217;s HOIHI Grant Program. Through showing respect, visitors (tourists) can then be welcomed as guests with a shared kuleana (responsibility) in perpetuating the values and importance of Native Hawaiian traditional knowledge and cultural practices. This olelo noeau serves as a foundational guide for ONHR&#8217;s HOIHI Grant Program to aide in actions that:Showcase the heritage, places, art, foods, traditions, history and continuing vitality of the Native Hawaiian Community;Identify, enhance, revive, or maintain loea (cultural traditions and practices), wahi kupuna (ancestral spaces) and wahi pana (sacred spaces) that are important to sustain the distinctiveness of the Native Hawaiian Community; andProvide for authentic and respectful visitor experiences in Hawaii.",

Studies appropriate for this announcement include clinical trials to develop and test behavior change interventions related to dental, oral, or craniofacial conditions. Awards made under this FOA will initially support a milestone-driven planning phase (UG3) for up to 2 years, with possible transition to a clinical trial implementation phase (UH3) of up to five years. Only UG3 projects that have met the scientific milestones and feasibility requirements may transition to the UH3 phase. The UG3/UH3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this FOA. The UG3 phase will permit both scientific and operational planning activities. Scientific planning activities include small-scale data collection to assess the feasibility and/or acceptability of a planned behavioral or social intervention and associated study procedures (e.g., acceptability of study content or mode of delivery; feasibility of proposed data collection procedures; preliminary testing of intervention training and fidelity monitoring procedures). Operational planning activities include, at a minimum, development of: the final clinical protocol; the intervention manual or equivalent; the data management system and other tools for data and quality management, safety and operational oversight plans; recruitment and retention strategies; and other essential documents. The UH3 phase will support the conduct of investigator-initiated intervention research at all stages, from early mechanistic research and intervention development (e.g., Stages 0/ I) through implementation and cost-effectiveness research (Stages IV/V).",

The Department of State will entertain applications for continuation grants funded under these awards beyond the initial budget period on a non-competitive basis subject to availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the program, and a determination that continued funding would be in the best interest of the U.S. Department of State. This notice is subject to availability of funding. 1. Executive SummaryPriority Region: WHA, Central America, Costa Rica Executive Summary This project seeks to help Costa Rican journalists report on crime more safely and effectively. It focuses on crimes related to organized criminal networks and drug trafficking&#8212;including environmental, property, and violent crimes. Many of these crimes go unreported because victims, communities, journalists, and even police are afraid. This grant will be awarded to a nonprofit organization that will train reporters, provide them with gear, and create better connections between journalists and municipal police, working through the Judicial Police (OIJ) and the Ministry of Public Security press offices. The goal is to improve the quality and safety of crime reporting. A. Eligibility 1. Eligible ApplicantsThe following organizations are eligible to apply: Not-for-profit organizations, including think tanks and civil society/non-governmental organizations Individuals Public International Organizations and Governmental institutions 2. Cost Sharing or MatchingN/A 3. Other Eligibility RequirementsAll organizations must have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) issued via SAM.gov as well as a valid registration in SAM.gov. Please see Section D.3 for more information. Individuals are not required to have a UEI or be registered in SAM.gov. B. Program Description 1. Goals and Objectives This program will support safer and more robust and sophisticated crime reporting in Costa Rica thereby contributing to a safer hemisphere. Many crimes go unreported because people are afraid to speak out. This includes crimes that harm the environment, property, and people. These crimes are often connected to organized crime and drug trafficking. The grant will fund an organization to: Train journalists to safely report on crime. Give reporters the equipment they need, such as protective vests and secure communication tools. Hold workshops with municipal police and OIJ agents to build trust and improve how journalists get information. Support a network of journalists covering crime in rural and coastal areas. Give target audiences a better understanding of the United States, including an understanding of how organizations in the United States work to keep journalists safe when reporting on crime. What we expect to see: At least 40 journalists trained. At least 10 joint events with police. More reporting about crime in areas that were previously silent. Safer practices among journalists when reporting on sensitive issues thereby contributing to more robust and sophisticated crime reporting in Costa Rica that makes the hemisphere safer. Applications should include a U.S. element in their proposal that will help target audiences better understand how organizations in the United States work to keep journalists safe when reporting on crime.

The primary motivation of the NOFO is to understand the consequences of natural and human-made disasters, emerging environmental public health threats, and policy changes in the U.S. and abroad. A distinguishing feature of an appropriate study is the need for rapid review and funding, substantially shorter than the typical NIH grant review/award cycle, for the research question to be addressed and swiftly implemented. The shortened timeframe will be achieved by more frequent application due dates and expediting peer review, council concurrence and award issuance. The entire cycle, from submission to award, is expected to be within 4-6 months.",

For this NOFO, natural products include promising nutritional regimens that standardize the amount of a specific naturally occurring nutritional compound (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, anthocyanidins, or polyphenols) and have compelling preliminary evidence. All applications submitted under this NOFO must be supported by sufficient preliminary data demonstrating bioavailability (if applicable) and documentation that the natural product produces a reproducible and measurable impact on target engagement (i.e., measure of the mechanism of action). Only in cases when it is not possible/practical to measure target engagement in the patient population of interest or when there is a fundamental understanding of the products mechanism of action will this preliminary data requirement be waived. Applications submitted to this NOFO should propose a mid-phase clinical trial to do the following: determine the optimal dose or formulation of a given natural product for use in a future multi-site efficacy trial; or determine which patient phenotypes will be responders versus non-responders to the natural product to inform inclusion/exclusion criteria of a future efficacy trial. Clinical trials submitted under this NOFO are expected to be hypothesis based, milestone-driven, and directly related to the research priorities and mission of NCCIH. This NOFO will not support single-site or multi-site efficacy or effectiveness trials, nor will it support trials to test natural products for the treatment or prevention of cancer.

For this NOFO, natural products include promising nutritional regimens that standardize the amount of a specific naturally occurring nutritional compound (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids, anthocyanidins, or polyphenols) and have compelling preliminary evidence. Under this NOFO, trials must be designed so that results, whether positive or negative, will provide information of high scientific utility and will support decisions about further development or testing of the natural product. This NOFO will provide up to 3 years support for studies to replicate the impact of the natural product on target engagement when used by humans, and assess whether there is an association between the degree of the impact on target engagement and functional or clinical outcomes in a patient population. Applications are encouraged to design studies to determine how to optimize the impact of the natural product on target engagement by optimizing the delivery of the natural product through examination of different doses or formulations. In addition, applications can be designed to combine the natural product with another treatment approach that is known to engage the same target; or study the impact of the natural product in a target population that is more responsive. Clinical trials submitted under this NOFO are expected to be hypothesis based, milestone-driven, and directly related to the research priorities and mission of NCCIH.

Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular[a] activities that have been shown to be effective in supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM. To be eligible, scholars must be domestic low-income students with academic ability, talent, or potential and demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that such a field serves a critical need in the United States. [a] an activity at a school or college pursued in addition to the normal course of study. S-STEM Eligible Degree Programs Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Engineering, and Associate of Applied Science Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Applied Science Master of Arts, Master of Science, and Master of Engineering Doctoral (Ph.D. or other comparable doctoral degree) S-STEM Eligible Disciplines Disciplinary fields in which research is funded by NSF, including technology fields associated with the S-STEM-eligible disciplines (e.g., biotechnology, chemical technology, engineering technology, information technology, etc.). The following degrees and disciplines areexcluded: Clinical degree programs, including medical degrees, nursing, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, and others not funded by NSF, are ineligible degrees. Programs for STEM teacher certification or licensure currently covered by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program (NOYCE) are ineligible for S-STEM funding. Business school programs that lead to Bachelor of Arts or Science in Business Administration degrees (BABA/BSBA/BBA) are not eligible for S-STEM funding. Masters and Doctoral degrees in Business Administration are also excluded. Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact Program Officers before submitting a proposal if they have questions concerning degree or disciplinary eligibility. The S-STEM program particularly encourages proposals from 2-year institutions, predominately undergraduate institutions, and urban, suburban, and rural public institutions.",

        "description": "Our world is at a pivotal moment where the boundaries dividing the physical and social worlds from the cyber world have become blurred. Cyberspace has evolved from an interconnected digital environment into a complex and interdependent cyber ecosystem that involves hardware, software, networks, data, people, organizations, countries, and the physical world. Critical functions of everyday life are deeply intertwined with computing, including health, government, commerce, the public sphere, education, critical infrastructure, interpersonal communication, and transportation. The complexity and inter-dependencies in cyberspace can be misused and exploited by malicious actors. These in turn can trigger adverse outcomes such as disruption of critical infrastructure and systems; theft of intellectual property and sensitive data; amplification of inequalities; disclosure of private information of individuals, organizations, and governments; and threats to lives, livelihoods, and reputations. Furthermore, constant attacks on the data and assets of corporations, governments, and individuals undermine people&#8217;s trust in decision-making and processes that depend critically on these cyber systems. The Security, Privacy, and Trust in Cyberspace (SaTC 2.0) program aims to build trust in global cyber ecosystems. Trust is the core tenet of this program and, for the purposes of this solicitation, is broadly defined to include our confidence in the security, privacy, and resilience of cyberspace, particularly in the face of malicious intent. Achieving this level of confidence in cyberspace requires not only understanding the vulnerabilities in a system that could be exploited and how they can be addressed, but also understanding the social and technical dimensions of trust in cyber systems, along with the educational efforts needed to increase public awareness of risks in cyberspace, and building a well-trained corps of privacy and security professionals. SaTC 2.0 spans the interests of NSF&apos;s Directorates for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and STEM Education (EDU). Proposals must be submitted pursuant to one of the following designations, each of which may have additional requirements: RES: The Research (RES) designation is the focus of the multidisciplinary SaTC 2.0 research program. RES projects are limited to $1,200,000 in total budget, with durations of up to four years. Proposals with a total budget of more than $600,000 have additional requirements including Broadening Participation in Computing and collaboration plans. RES proposals may include an optional Transition to Education (TTE) plan with a budget up to $50,000 (within the RES total budget request) to co-evolve novel educational initiatives in the context of the proposed research. EDU: The Education (EDU) designation is used to identify proposals focusing on education and workforce training in building trust in security, privacy, and resilience of cyberspace. EDU proposals are limited to $500,000 in total budget, with durations of up to three years. EDU proposals that primarily focus on education research with demonstrated collaboration, as reflected in the PI team between cybersecurity subject matter experts and education researcher(s), may request an additional $100,000 beyond the $500,000 limit. SEED: The Seedling (SEED) category is intended for special topics defined by accompanying Dear Colleague Letters. SEED projects are limited to $300,000 in total budget, with durations of up to two years. ",

The purpose of this Centers program is to accelerate innovation of diabetes translation to maximize positive impacts of research on population health through activities and core services that offer specialized expertise, tools, education, and support. An emphasis on novel methods and research to address health equity and reduce diabetes-related health disparities is encouraged. Novel research cores designed to improve other aspects of person-centered, community, and population health are also encouraged with justification of how such findings or strategies may be adapted to meaningfully inform disparity-reduction approaches. A scientific base reflecting academic institutions and diverse organizational collaborators (e.g., healthcare systems, community organizations, health departments, human services) is expected to foster a Center framework necessary for improving population health. CDTRs are based on the core concept whereby shared resources aimed at fostering productivity, synergy, and novel research ideas among the funded investigators are supported in a cost-effective manner.",

        "description": "A central goal of the BRAIN Initiative is to understand how electrical and chemical signals code information in neural circuits and give rise to sensations, thoughts, emotions and actions. While currently available technologies can provide some understanding, they may not be sufficient to accomplish this goal. For example, non-invasive technologies are low resolution and/or provide indirect measures such as blood flow, which are imprecise; invasive technologies can provide information at the level of single neurons producing the fundamental biophysical signals, but they can only be applied to tens or hundreds of neurons, out of a total number in the human brain estimated at 85 billion.Other BRAIN FOAs seek to develop novel technology (RFA-NS-17-003) or to optimize existing technology ready for in-vivo proof-of-concept testing and collection of preliminary data (RFA-NS-17-004) for recording or manipulating neural activity on a scale that is beyond what is currently possible. This FOA seeks applications for unique and innovative technologies that are in an even earlier stage of development than that sought in other FOAs, including new and untested ideas that are in the initial stages of conceptualization.In addition to experimental approaches, the support provided under this FOA might enable calculations, simulations, computational models, or other mathematical techniques for demonstrating that the signal sources and/or measurement technologies are theoretically capable of meeting the demands of large-scale recording or manipulation of circuit activity in humans or in animal models. The support might also be used for building and testing phantoms, prototypes, in-vitro or other bench-top models in order to validate underlying theoretical assumptions in preparation for future FOAs aimed at testing in animal models.",

        "description": "This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) invites applications for the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) Program, administered by the National Park Service (NPS). The ORLP Program is a competitive grant initiative under the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act, aimed at enhancing parks, recreational opportunities, and conservation areas in urban, underserved communities. It complements the LWCF Stateside and Local Assistance Program formula grants to address the needs of these areas.The LWCF State and Local Assistance Program works with designated state, commonwealth, and territory agencies to provide grants to subrecipients: community organizations, local governments, federally recognized Tribes, Alaska Native Corporations (ANC), Alaska Native Organizations (ANO), and the Native Hawaiian Communities. These grants fund the acquisition and development of parks and outdoor recreation areas, as well as the renovation of existing facilities. Since ORLP projects are funded by LWCF they follow the same requirements to receive an award.To qualify for LWCF funds, each state must maintain an approved Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (SCORP), which evaluates the supply and demand for outdoor recreation resources and sets funding priorities. Since ORLP projects are funded by LWCF, they must also align with their state&#8217;s SCORP. Funding for the ORLP Program does not impact a state or territory&#8217;s LWCF State and Local Assistance Program formula grant apportionment.As per the LWCF Act, a 1:1 or 50% minimum non-Federal share is required for ORLP award eligibility. Funds or in-kind contributions, such as land or services acquired with most other Federal funds, are not eligible for matching. Exceptions exist, however, for funds authorized by their enabling legislation to be treated as non-federal match. Common options include HUD&#8217;s Community Development Block Grants and Federal Highway Administration&#8217;s Recreation Trails Program.",

Extramural research funded under this NOFO may include investigations of preanalytical variability associated with the procurement and study of small biopsies (core biopsies, small excision samples), blood utilized for &quot;liquid biopsies&quot;, tissue swabs, tissue secretions, pleural and esophageal aspirates, feces, or bodily fluids like sweat, urine, CSF, breast milk and saliva. Investigator-designed experiments will explore how different biospecimen preanalytical conditions affect emerging and clinically relevant biomarkers quantified by a variety of testing platforms. The results from this research program will improve the understanding of how analytical quantification of clinically relevant biomarkers is affected by variation in biospecimen collection, processing, and storage procedures.

Active NHLBI K01, K08, K23, and K25 awardees may apply for R03 support after the notices of award (NoA) for their first type-5 K awards have been issued. Recently completed NHLBI K01, K08, K23, and K25 awardees are eligible to apply for the R03 if the earliest possible R03 start date falls within 2 years of their prior NHLBI K award Project Period end date. This FOA is intended to enhance the capability of NHLBI K01, K08, K23, and K25 awardees to conduct research as they complete their transition to fully independent investigator status. This R03 grant mechanism is intended to support research projects that can be carried out and completed within a short period of time (no more than two years) with limited resources and that may generate preliminary data to support a subsequent R01-equivalent application. These studies include, but not limited to, pilot or feasibility studies; proof of concept studies; secondary analysis of existing data; small, self-contained research projects; development of new research methodologies or technologies, or development of novel experimental models. For current and previous K23 awardees, research proposed in the R03 application may or may not include patient-oriented research. A minimum of 40% protected overall research effort is required from applicants during the R03 award period and can be met through a combination of effort on the proposed R03 and other research projects, regardless of funding source.",

The NHLBI expects that applications to this NOFO will describe the planned clinical trial and in so doing demonstrate that the proposed (R34) research is scientifically necessary to design or plan the subsequent trial. Furthermore, this NOFO will support research projects that are designed to provide results that will be sufficient to inform the future trial without further studies. The planned Phase II, III, or IV trial must be primarily intended to test the efficacy, safety, clinical management, or implementation of intervention(s) in the prevention and/or treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. In contrast to the study start up or preparation phase of NHLBI funding opportunities for clinical trials (as described at https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/funding-opportunities-and-contacts/clinical-trials-optimization), the R34 mechanism is intended to provide new information that answers a scientific or operational question(s) which may be pragmatic in nature and, therefore, informs the final development of a Phase II-IV clinical trial.

        "description": "DOE&#8217;s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) is issuing this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO), in collaboration with the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) and National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), for integrated carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects that demonstrate substantial improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness, cost, and environmental performance of carbon capture technologies for power, industrial, and other commercial applications. The overarching goal of this NOFO is to unlock a wave of follow-on investment in low-carbon power and low-carbon industrial products by increasing the capital flow to sectors where it is already occurring and by expanding the CCUS market to additional power, industrial, and commercial applications. Awards made under this NOFO will be funded with funds appropriated by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, more commonly known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL). The BIL will invest up to $2.537 billion to fund domestic CCUS demonstration and commercial-scale projects that further the development, deployment, and commercialization of technologies to capture and geologically store CO2 emissions. In addition, the BIL has a total appropriation of $937 million for fiscal years (FY) 2022 through 2025 for large-scale pilot projects that accelerate the development, deployment, and commercialization of innovative and transformative carbon capture technologies. This NOFO makes available up to $1,300,000,000 for approximately 10 projects at maximum Federal cost shares ranging from 50% to 80%, depending on the Topic Area and Phase of the project. The NOFO is divided into three Topic Areas based on the technology readiness level (TRL) and scope of the proposed project. DOE will select projects that seek to demonstrate the following, based on the chosen Topic Area: &#8226; Topic Area 1 &#8211; The technical and commercial viability of established carbon capture technologies (TRL &gt;7) in both new applications and at commercial scale. &#8226; Topic Area 2 &#8211; First-of-a-kind transformational technologies (TRL 5&#8211;6) at the large pilot scale. &#8226; Topic Area 3 &#8211; Region-specific carbon management networks with multiple emitters to reduce offtake uncertainty and increase emitter access to storage facilities.

        "description": "Through this solicitation, the Antarctic Sciences Section (ANT) of the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) funds cutting-edge research that: Improves understanding of interactions among the Antarctic region and global systems. Improves understanding of the dynamic linkages among processes operating in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean and linkages to global Earth systems, which helps inform decision making regarding environmental change. Advances fundamental understanding of Earth systems and the biological, geochemical, and physical processes in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean as drivers and responders to changes on a global scale. Expands fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes. Utilizes the unique characteristics of the Antarctic region as a science observing platform. Builds capacity and enhances the US workforce for polar-related science. ANT encourages and supports research that combines disciplinary perspectives and approaches from other fields, research that uses existing data and samples, and other research not requiring a physical presence in Antarctica.This may include projects conducted at locations outside Antarctica that serve as analogues of Antarctic sites or systems. This solicitation does not support projects that would need logistical support from the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP).Proposers requiring USAP logistical support should consult theAntarctic Sciences web page for current opportunities. Proposers of projects with logistics needs that would be wholly provided by another Antarctic program or organization should contact an ANT Program Officer for guidance.",

        "description": "NOTICE: Amended March 31, 2025. This program no longer accepts proposals involving rodent or any other vertebrate experiments on the International Space Station. Proposals involving rodent or vertebrate experiments on the ground are still allowed. The link to request tissues from NBISC has been updated (see Section 2.2.5). The due date for Step-2 proposals has been delayed: Step-2 proposals are now due June 2, 2025. New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through. Links to the GCAM have been updated. NOTICE: Amended January 28, 2025. The due dates for Step-1 and Step-2 proposals have been delayed: Step-1 proposals are now due February 25, 2025, and Step-2 proposals are now due May 20, 2025. In addition, eligibility criteria have been added to Section 1, eligibility of applicants for Early Career Investigations in Section 2.2.2 has been clarified, Section 2.1.2 (Space Crops) has been clarified regarding the types of organisms that can be used, and in Section 3.2.2.3, the link for the BPS Data Management Policy has been replaced with the link for the BPS Data Management Webpage, that houses the policy document in question. New text is in bold and deleted text is struck through. &#65279;The close date above is the date for the Step-1 proposal submission. See the solicitation for the Step-2 due date. Step-2 proposals cannot be submitted if a Step-1 proposal was not submitted. Proposers must retrieve the instructions document (zip file) associated with the application package for this opportunity as there is at least one required form that must be attached to the submitted proposal package. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Science Mission Directorate (SMD) released its annual omnibus Research Announcement (NRA), Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES) &#8211; 2024 (OMB Approval Number 2700-0092, CFDA Number 43.001) on February 14, 2024. In this case &quot;omnibus&quot; means that this NRA has many individual program elements, each with its own due dates and topics. All together these cover the wide range of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences supported by SMD. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers, depending on the nature of the work proposed, the proposing organization, and/or program requirements. However, most extramural research awards deriving from ROSES will be grants, and many program elements of ROSES specifically exclude contracts, because contracts would not be appropriate for the nature of the work solicited. The typical period of performance for an award is three years, but some programs may allow up to five years and others specify shorter periods. In most cases, organizations of every type, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, domestic and foreign (with some caveats), may submit proposals without restriction on teaming arrangements. Tables listing the program elements and due dates (Tables 2 and 3), a table that provides a very top level summary of proposal contents (Table 1), and the full text of the ROSES-2024 &quot;Summary of Solicitation&quot;, may all be found NSPIRES at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024. This synopsis is associated with one of the individual program elements within ROSES, but this is a generic summary that is posted for all ROSES elements. For specific information on this particular program element download and read the PDF of the text of this program element by going to Tables 2 or 3 of this NRA at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table2 and http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2024table3, respectively, click the title of the program element of interest, a hypertext link will take you to a page for that particular program element. On that page, on the right side under &quot;Announcement Documents&quot; the link on the bottom will be to the PDF of the text of the call for proposals. For example, if one were interested in The Lunar Data Analysis Program (NNH24ZDA001N-LDAP) one would follow the link to the NSPIRES page for that program element and then to read the text of the call one would click on &#8220;C.8 Lunar Data Analysis Program (.pdf)&#8221; to download the text of the call. If one wanted to set it into the context of the goals, objectives and know the default rules for all elements within Appendix C, the planetary science division, one might download and read &#8220;C.1 Planetary Science Research Program Overview (.pdf)&#8221; from that same page. While the letters and numbers are different for each element within ROSES (A.12, B.7, etc.) the basic configuration is always the same, e.g., the letter indicates the Science Division (A is Earth Science, B is Heliophysics etc.) and whatever the letter, #1 is always the division overview. Frequently asked questions for ROSES are posted at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs. Questions concerning general ROSES-2024 policies and procedures may be directed to Max Bernstein, Lead for Research, Science Mission Directorate, at sara@nasa.gov, but technical questions concerning specific program elements should be directed to the point(s) of contact for that particular element, who may be found either at the end of the individual program element in the summary table of key information or on the web list of topics and points of contact at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list. Not all program elements are known at the time of the release of ROSES. To be informed of new program elements or amendments to this NRA, proposers may subscribe to: (1) The SMD mailing lists (by logging in at http://nspires.nasaprs.com and checking the appropriate boxes under &quot;Account Management&quot; and &quot;Email Subscriptions&quot;), (2) The ROSES-2024 blog feed for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to at https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/solicitations/roses-2024/, and (3) The ROSES-2024 due date Google calendars (one for each science division).

        "description": "This solicitation addresses issues of translation and diffusion that arise in moving knowledge gained from fundamental learning and education research toward application in PreK-12 STEM classroom practice or leveraging knowledge derived from effective practice toward driving fundamental research. The first goal of this funding opportunity is to encourage the scientific study of theories, frameworks, and models for the translation and diffusion of knowledge, especially between fields and across contexts and levels-of-analysis (e.g., biological to cognitive/socioemotional to behavioral; individual to classroom to broader demographic variables; lab to classroom to school to district). The second goal is to advance or move specific practice, research or scientific discovery in STEM education reciprocally along the research-practice continuum. The Translation and Diffusion (TD) solicitation invites four types of proposals: Research on Translation or Diffusion proposals request funding to conduct scholarship that will advance the sciences of translation or diffusion of fundamental research knowledge toward PreK-12 formal STEM education practice by developing or refining theories, frameworks, or models (or adapting those from other domains) and conducting related research. Such proposals may also address the leveraging of effective classroom practices toward the enrichment of foundational research, constructs and models. We note that bi-directional movement across boundaries is a mutually beneficial reciprocal process. Proof-of-Concept Research proposals request funding to explore the feasibility and viability of particular knowledge or products generated from STEM education research toward advancing practice in formal PreK-12 settings (even if it is still basic or applied research and development rather than implementation). The goals are to facilitate the process by which the promise that the initial insight holds for research and practice can be realized. The outcome of such a project would lay the methodological, theoretical, empirical, design, or social foundation for conducting systematic work at the next stage of development or at the next level of analysis. Empirical and theory-building efforts to adapt initial insights from research or practice across significantly different contexts, populations, domains, and levels-of-analysis are also welcome. Synthesis proposals critically integrate the current state of knowledge on a particular topic relevant to translation and diffusion in formal PreK-12 STEM education. Such proposals should include the state of the knowledge across disciplinary communities and across relevant literatures, identify the lacunae in STEM education knowledge, and, where appropriate, lay out thenext steps for future research and development. Conference / Workshop proposals relevant to the call are also welcome.",

The UG3/UH3 Phase Innovation Awards Cooperative Agreement involves 2 phases. The UG3 is to support a project with specific milestones to be accomplished by the end of the 2-year period. The UH3 is to provide funding for 3 years to a project that successfully completed the milestones set in the UG3. UG3 projects that have met their milestones will be administratively considered by NIDA and prioritized for transition to the UH3 phase. Investigators responding to this NOFO must address both UG3 and UH3 phases. Application may include preclinical or clinical research studies that will have high impact and quickly yield the necessary results to advance closer to FDA approval medications that are safe and effective to prevent and treat SUDs and overdose. The compounds to be evaluated can be small molecules, biologics, or natural products. They can be tested in pre-clinical models and/or for the clinical manifestations of SUDs such as withdrawal, craving, relapse, or overdose. Applications may focus on the development of new chemical entities, new formulations of marketed medications available for other indications, or combinations of medications that hold promise for the treatment of SUDs and overdose. Through this NOFO, NIDA seeks to fast-track the discovery and development of medications to prevent and treat SUDs or overdose and to advance them in the FDA&apos;s drug development approval pipeline.",

Many NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs) use this NRSA program exclusively to support intensive, short-term research training experiences for health professional students (medical students, veterinary students, and/or students in other health-professional programs) during the summer. This program is also intended to encourage training of graduate students in the physical or quantitative sciences to pursue interests in research careers by short-term exposure to, and involvement in, the health-related sciences. The training should be of sufficient depth to enable the trainees, upon completion of the program, to have a thorough exposure to the principles underlying the conduct of biomedical research.",

        "description": "Historic battlefields and associated sites of armed conflict are powerful reminders of the shared heritage of all Americans. In an ongoing effort to extend the conservation of natural and cultural resources beyond our park boundaries, the National Park Service American Battlefield Protection Program (NPS ABPP) promotes the preservation and interpretation of these important places. NPS ABPP supports community-driven stewardship of historic resources through four grant opportunities: Preservation Planning, Battlefield Restoration, Battlefield Interpretation, and Battlefield Land Acquisition.NPS ABPP administers Battlefield Land Acquisition Grants (BLAG) to assist State and local governments with the preservation of eligible Revolutionary War, War of 1812, and Civil War battlefield lands through acquisition of fee-simple or less-than-fee (easement) interests. Funding for the BLAG program is made available from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and is awarded competitively. Each grant requires a dollar-for-dollar non-Federal match. Grants are available to acquire interests in eligible Civil War battlefields listed in the Civil War sites Advisory Commission&apos;s (CWSAC) Report on the Nation&apos;s Civil War Battlefields (1993) and in the principal battlefields of the Revolutionary War and War of 1812 identified in NPS ABPP&#8217;s Report to Congress on the Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Sites in the United States (2007) (Survey Reports).In accordance with 54 U.S.C. &#167; 308103(b), Battlefield Acquisition Grant Program, this funding opportunity is limited to state or local governments. Nonprofit organizations may acquire an interest in an eligible site by partnering in an application from a state or local government which has jurisdiction over the property interest to be acquired. The government agency will be the grant recipient and serve as a pass-through entity for Federal funds to the nonprofit organization (2 C.F.R. &#167; 200.1).Applications are accepted and evaluated on a rolling basis. As our nation approaches the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence in 2026, NPS ABPP encourages projects that promote and expand preservation as well as enhance our understanding of the origins of the United States. NPS ABPP BLAG funds may not be used to acquire land or interests in land within the legislative boundary of a unit of the National Park System. Grant recipients are required to provide for public access and enjoyment of lands or interests in lands acquired with NPS ABPP funds in a manner consistent with the preservation goals of the program. Land acquired with these funds will be subject to the LWCF non-conversion requirements. Grant recipients and their nonprofit partners who acquire an interest in eligible lands must convey a perpetual preservation easement on the land to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) or to another organization acceptable to the National Park Service and SHPO.",

Information about the mission and research interests of the NINDS can be found at the NINDS website (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/). Studies proposed should provide a cost-effective means of collecting data with a meaningful bearing on current clinical practice. Awards made under this FOA will initially support a milestone-driven planning phase (UG3) for up to 2 years, with possible transition to a observational study phase of up to five years (UH3). Only UG3 projects that have met the scientific milestones and feasibility requirements may transition to the UH3 phase. The UG3/UH3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this FOA. The UG3 phase for observational studies will permit both scientific and operational planning activities. Scientific planning activities include small-scale data collection to assess the feasibility and/or acceptability of data collection, storage, and planned analyses. Operational planning activities include, at a minimum, development of recruitment and retention strategies, case report forms, data management system and other tools for data and quality management.

        "description": "This funding opportunity aims to support high risk clinical trials for the development of in vivo high-resolution structural and functional imaging technologies for the living human inner ear. Proposed projects should focus on improving the resolution of current imaging techniques or developing new imaging techniques that can visualize inner ear structures in vivo with significantly greater detail and accuracy than currently possible. Structural and functional aspects, including visualizing dynamic elements, are important to developing new and improved techniques. Projects may also focus on developing new imaging probes or contrast agents that can enhance visualization of the inner ear structures. Research supported in response to this RFA is expected to significantly advance the ability to visualize auditory and vestibular components, such as hair cells, otoliths, membranes, ions, and vasculature, in detail in awake patients in a clinical setting using non-invasive techniques. To achieve this goal, a multidisciplinary team approach that takes advantage of the expertise of each team member is highly encouraged. Studies in humans must be proposed to develop,advance, or test the needed technology. Any intermediate studies must articulate a clear path of the proposed methodology to application in awake humans or define the limitations and the usefulness in anesthetized humans.",

The program supports innovation across the cyberinfrastructure (CI) ecosystem to address accessibility, data curation, research data management, discoverability, reliability, reproducibility, preservation, sustainability, and utility of research products, including data software, and code, developed as part of funded projects. FAIROS proposals must select one of two tracks to focus on, either: 1)&#8239;Disciplinary Improvements&#8239;to targeted scientific communities, or&#8239;2)&#8239;Cross-Cutting Improvements&#8239;that apply to many or most scientific disciplines.&#8239;In the case of proposals focused on Disciplinary Improvements, it is strongly recommended that prospective PIs contact a program officer from the list of Cognizant Program Officers in the directorate closest to the major disciplinary impact of the proposed work to ascertain that the scientific focus and budget of the proposed work are appropriate for this solicitation. In the case of proposals focused on Cross-Cutting Improvements, it is strongly recommended that prospective PIs contact the&#8239;cognizant program officer from the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC). After selecting either Disciplinary Improvements or Cross-Cutting Improvements in which to focus research, the proposal must include the kinds of activities relevant to the selected track.&#8239;Standard research proposals are the only type of proposal accepted in response to this solicitation.

A Trailblazer project may be exploratory, developmental, proof of concept, or high risk-high impact, and may be technology design-directed, discovery-driven, or hypothesis-driven. Importantly, applicants must propose research approaches for which there are minimal or no preliminary data. A distinct feature for this FOA is that no preliminary data are required, expected, or encouraged. However, if available, minimal preliminary data are allowed. Preliminary data are defined as material which the applicant has independently produced and not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal. All preliminary data should be clearly marked and limited to one-half page, which may include one figure. Applications including data more than one-half page or more than one figure will be considered noncompliant with the FOA instructions and will not go forward to review.",

Activities such as outreach, boat ramp inspections, and/or law enforcement are often done outside the basin but make substantial contributions when work is done in areas where people are likely to transit (and thereby potentially transfer AIS) into the Great Lakes basin. Early detection, rapid response, and/or control efforts outside the basin must address:&#8226; Species with a substantial potential for interbasin transfer (e.g., hydrilla in a waterbody near the Great Lakes basin that receives heavy boat use).&#8226; Species of significant concern to the Great Lakes community within a Great Lakes state.&#8226; Activities where the primary motivation is to prevent transfer of AIS into the Great Lakes basin.In the end, we are pursuing and funding whatever actions have the greatest benefit to the Great Lakes Basin.INVASIVE CARP WORK IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION IF IT HAS BEEN INITIALLY SUBMITTED AND VETTED THROUGH THE ANNUAL DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE INVASIVE CARP REGIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE&apos;S (ICRCC) INVASIVE CARP ACTION PLAN.

        "description": "The current economic model used across the world is largely linear, where resources are extracted and made into products that are discarded at their end of use. This continual demand for primary materials often creates supply chain insecurity, as many critical resources are not available domestically. In addition, the standard linear economy model results in significant energy use and carbon emissions, generates large volumes of waste, and removes materials from the economy that still have significant value. Instead, a circular economy model promotes retaining products and materials in the economy as long as possible, using pathways such as reuse, repair, remanufacture, and recycling. This contributes to secure, domestic supply chains of important materials, minimizes the environmental impacts of the products and materials we use, and maximizes economic benefits by keeping products and materials in the economy as long as possible. Advancing a circular economy is critical to achieving&#191;the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy&apos;s (EERE&apos;s) mission. Recently, EERE published Circularity for Secure and Sustainable Products and Materials: A Draft Strategic Framework, along with a Request for Information (RFI).1 This Strategic Framework describes EERE&#8217;s goals and efforts in circularity across the products and materials that are most important to clean energy technologies. It also identifies challenges and opportunities to leverage circularity for securing supply chains, advancing decarbonization, benefiting communities, and creating jobs. The Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO) led the development of this document; taking a wholistic approach to advancing a more circular economy is a key focus of AMMTO&#8217;s secure and sustainable materials program. Unlike most approaches to increasing supply chain security and decarbonization, circularity has the potential to have a significant impact in the near term. We are in a unique moment where awareness of and investment in circularity is growing, and technologies are being developed to advance these goals. This is an important opportunity to capitalize on this momentum and take ambitious actions that will drive national-level impacts in advancing the circular economy. One major conclusion from the Strategic Framework is that major advancements in circularity cannot be done through technology development alone, they require the alignment of technology, policy, business models, and other factors. Analysis is needed to identify future work across these areas, and a vast array of stakeholders must be connected to carry it out. AMMTO and EERE have invested in innovations for circularity that have the potential for even greater impact if this technology development is incorporated into a broader, more wholistic approach to circularity by incorporating stakeholders with expertise in factors like policy and business models.",

        "description": "Since 1980, the Veterans&apos; Cemetery Grants Program (VCGP) has awarded grants totaling over $1.1 billion that states (46), tribes (14) and 3 territories (Guam, Saipan, and Puerto Rico) used to establish, expand, improve, operate, or maintain a total of 122 Veterans cemeteries. In 2024, VCGP cemeteries interred more than 42,720 Veterans and eligible family members, which is approximately 24% of the total annual interments in all national, state, territory, and tribal cemeteries (176,965). In 2025, the program will open two new state cemeteries, the New York State Veterans Cemetery - Finger Lakes in New York and the Nebraska Veterans Cemetery at Grand Island in Nebraska, bringing the total to 124 VCGP funded Veterans cemeteries. These two cemeteries will provide burial options to an additional 24,907 unserved Veterans and their eligible family members. Additionally, VCGP&#8217;s 125th grant-funded state Veterans&#8217; cemetery in Lubbock, Texas is planned to open in December 2025. Once completed, this cemetery will provide access to 19,923 Veterans that were previously unserved. This listing is to solicit FY25 pre-applications for the development of grant funded projects included in the FY26 priority list. Grants may be used only to establish, expand, or improve Veterans cemeteries that are owned and operated by a state, territory or tribal government on trust land. Federal Financial Assistance is granted only to states, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribal governments, not to private organizations, cities, or other government agencies. The US Department of Veteran Affairs (US-DVA) provides up to 100 percent of the development cost for an approved project. US-DVA can only provide operating equipment for the establishment of new cemeteries. US-DVA cannot pay for land acquisition. Cemeteries funded under the grant program must conform to the standards and guidelines pertaining to site selection, planning and construction prescribed by US-DVA. Cemeteries must comply with Build America, Buy America Act (BABAA) requirements in Title IX, Sections 70901 &#8211; 70952, Public Law, 117-58 that ensure all iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials are produced in the United States. Cemeteries must certify that they will use grant funds for projects that meet BABAA domestic content procurement preferences. All iron, steel, and construction materials used in VA-funded projects must be produced or manufactured in the U.S., and all manufactured products used in the project must be produced in the U.S. (cost of the components of the U.S. manufactured product must be greater than 55% of the total cost of all components). Cemeteries must be operated solely for the interment of Veterans (as defined in 38 CFR 39.2), and their eligible family members (see 38 CFR 39.10). Additionally, because of a recent change in the law, a grantee cemetery may also inter the individuals defined in 38 U.S.C. 2408(i)(2), who are ineligible for burial in a US-DVA National Cemetery. More information about this new authority can be found on the NCA Notices webpage, accessible using this link: https://www.cem.va.gov/policies/notices.asp The administration, operation, and maintenance of a US-DVA grant funded cemetery is solely the responsibility of the state, territory, or tribal government. As part of Veterans&#8217; Burial Benefits, US-DVA can provide a &quot;plot allowance&quot; of up to $978 for expenses incurred in the burial of certain eligible Veterans.",

Please review the attached notice for full details. Background: The goal of PEMS is to measurably and substantially reduce the prevalence of human trafficking and the harms associated with the crime in targeted populations through innovative interventions driven by research, monitoring, evaluation, and learning, and the expansion of partnerships with government, academia, civil society organizations, international organizations and the private sector. The U.S. Congress has appropriated $25 million annually since 2016 for PEMS, with $200 million in funding obligated to date. The TIP Office intends to further build the evidence base around what interventions work effectively to address trafficking in persons through funding the implementation and rigorous evaluation of high-potential and high-impact promising interventions. The TIP Office intends to consider interventions that have some evidence pointing to their effectiveness which could benefit from an evaluation to validate the intervention approach and answer important research questions about what is effective in anti-trafficking in persons programming. The TIP Office will consider interventions that have shown promise but have not had the funding to be rigorously evaluated; interventions that have shown success in other fields but have not been adapted and tested as a human trafficking intervention; and interventions for which there is a design for programming supported by significant research, which have not yet had the funding to implement and evaluate. Local expertise will be considered critical for implementing projects under this future opportunity. Please review the full notice attached.",

        "description": "Listing a plant or animal as federally protected under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is proven to be successful in preventing extinction. However, this level of protection is America&quot;s last line of defense. Before a species may warrant listing and protections under the ESA, many voluntary conservation opportunities can be undertaken. Voluntary actions can improve conditions for species and improve habitats for at-risk, listed, and common species alike. At-risk species conservation is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&quot;s (FWS) initiative promoting proactive conservation of fish, wildlife, and plants with partners before the species warrant protections under the ESA. The FWS collaborates with all partners (Federal and State agencies, Tribes, private landowners, non-government organizations, and industries) across all landscapes to implement this initiative. The FWS&quot;s at-risk species efforts are intended to encourage and support voluntary actions that proactively conserve species and their habitats. We believe that if we work with partners to improve the status of species before they come to the FWS for review under the ESA, we may be able to reduce the impact of stressors and stabilize or increase populations. Ideally, this proactive conservation work may help us avoid listing these species, thus improving species and their habitat, while simultaneously reducing regulatory burden.",

        "description": "The purpose of this notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) is to support research on interventions to improve health in Native American (NA) populations. This includes 1) etiologic research, where there is a significant gap in knowledge, that will directly inform intervention development or adaptations, 2) research that develops, adapts, or tests the efficacy or effectiveness of health promotion and disease prevention interventions, 3) research that tests culturally informed treatment or recovery interventions and 4) where a sufficient body of knowledge on intervention efficacy exists, research on dissemination and implementation that develops and tests strategies to overcome barriers to the adoption, integration, scale-up, and sustainability of effective interventions. Existing data suggest that significant acute and chronic disease inequities exist for NA populations. Concurrently, NA populations experience unique sociopolitical, historical, and environmental stressors and risks that may exacerbate health conditions and/or impact the effectiveness of existing solutions to address the conditions. They also possess unique strengths and resiliencies that can mitigate stressors or inform intervention strategies. Through this initiative, intervention and related research is sought to build upon community knowledge, resources, and resilience to test science-based, culturally appropriate solutions to reduce morbidity and mortality through identification and remediation of precursors to diseases and disorders and through culturally informed treatment. Interventions should be designed with a consideration for sustainability within the communities where they are tested, and have the flexibility to be readily adapted, disseminated, and scaled up to other communities where culturally appropriate. For the purposes of this NOFO, NA includes the following populations: Alaska Natives, American Indians (whose ancestral lands fall at least partially within the U.S. main land).",

        "description": "Wildland fire is a powerful force on the planet, one that is rapidly accelerating in complexity beyond our current understanding. A new approach is needed. This approach requires a proactive and scalable perspective that recognizes the variety and connectedness of components of wildland fire. Coordinated scientific research and education that enables large-scale, cross-cutting breakthroughs to transform our understanding of wildland fire is urgently needed. In an era of rapid change, our society needs forward-looking research built on new frameworks that will realign our relationship with wildland fire. The Fire Science Innovations through Research and Education (FIRE) program invites innovative multidisciplinary and multisector investigations focused on convergent research and education activities in wildland fire. All areas of science, engineering, and education supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation are included in this program. Projects developed by a wide array of groups including, for example, academics, educators, scientists, community members, students, industry partners, practitioners, resource managers, and Tribal representatives, working together to generate new knowledge of the interactions among biological, social, geoscientific, and engineering processes encompassing multiple fields, scales, and perspectives on wildland fire are encouraged. To advance convergent research and education in wildland fire science, FIRE proposals should demonstrate strengths in one or more of the following areas: (1) new advances in data collection, storage, and sharing relevant to wildland fire dynamics, including Earth observations; (2) new modeling and computational approaches to understand wildland fire (including artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches); (3) new understanding of the cross-scale interactions of wildland fire across local, regional and global extents; (4) new insights into community adaptation and governance relevant to wildland fire; (5) new approaches to reduce the vulnerability of built infrastructure, natural fuels, and social systems to wildland fire; and (6) engagement of a variety of community members and stakeholders to promote a forward-looking approach to wildland fire science. NSF manages the review of proposals in consultation with partner organizations. Copies of proposals and unattributed reviews will be shared with the partner organizations, as appropriate. FIRE supports research proposals and conference (network) proposals that focus on one or more of the following elements: Focus area 1: Next Generation Coupled Fire Models (FIRE-MODEL) Understanding wildland fires and smoke requires new predictive approaches and models to capture the full spatial and temporal range of unresolved dynamics. Furthermore, model development efforts necessitate well-coordinated experiments ranging from laboratory to landscape scales, along with state-of-the-art data management and analysis approaches. To reduce the current large uncertainties associated with fire models and to discover new weather-fire coupling phenomena driving the increasing frequency of large-scale fires worldwide, advanced experimental, theoretical, and computational methods are needed. The impacts of improved models include increased accuracy, better integration of Earth observation data, more efficient planning of prescribed burns, effective training of work force, timely warnings, and better management of limited human/equipment resources. Successful FIRE-MODEL proposals are suggested to address the following key themes: Innovative models, methods and algorithms for fire phenomena at disparate spatio-temporal scales, including systematic quantification of various sources of uncertainties and holistic verification and validation of the developed tools and technologies; Improvement of models with key measurable parameters spanning the full array of wildland fire factors as well as methods to bridge gaps of missing data; Incorporation of the underlying processes operating on fast and slow timescales, to potentially enable predictive fire ecology, exploration of possible future fire regimes, and forecasting of future wildland fires; and Novel mathematical and statistical methodologies and use-inspired technologies to accelerate experiments on wildland fire and smoke dynamics and reliably infer the associated uncertainties; such directions may include but are not limited to surrogate models and digital twins. Focus area 2: Enhancing Capacity for Fire Resilience in the Wildland-Urban Interface (FIRE-WUI) The space where the built environment and wildland vegetation meet is referred to as the wildland-urban interface (hereafter WUI). It represents a critical nexus of potential human-fire interaction, where lives, infrastructure, and communities are often most vulnerable to wildfire. Research related to the complexities of the WUI requires a convergent, multidisciplinary approach to improve understanding of wildland fire, which can inform risk management and response, adaptation and resilience across infrastructures, communities, cultures, and natural environments. Considering impacts of wildland fire at the WUI in the context of global change, including demographics, ecosystems, land use and development, FIRE-WUI awards will support research that may for example: Inform community adaptation and governance relevant to wildland fire; Investigate public perceptions and understanding of wildland fire as well as decision making and communication and the resultant impact on livelihoods and cultural heritage; Promote better understanding of the socioeconomic disparities related to the impacts of wildfire on remote rural communities; Test and model behaviors of building materials, structures, and infrastructures under wildfire loads; Develop novel materials, methods, and technologies for retrofitting existing buildings and remediating buildings following wildfire and smoke events; Create robust wildfire risk scenarios and algorithms for evaluating cascading failures and community-scale vulnerability. Focus area 3: Fire Science Innovations through Research and Education (FIRE) Networks (FIRE-NET) FIRE-Network projects will build new collaborative teams to synthesize aspects of wildland fire science and develop strategies for tackling key gaps. These networks will advance wildland fire research, or create new directions in research or education by supporting groups of investigators to communicate and coordinate their research, training, and educational activities across disciplinary, organizational, geographic, and international boundaries. Exchanging knowledge and information across and among different groups is encouraged. Projects will provide opportunities to foster new collaborations, including those with international partners where appropriate, and will address interdisciplinary knowledge and data exchange focused on wildland fire research and education. Successful FIRE-NET conference proposals are encouraged to include but are not limited to the following types of activities: Leveraging existing and developing data resources to support the development of new wildland fire-related research directions and educational activities; Employing novel networking strategies and collaborative training technologies to enhance coordination among a variety of fields and knowledge holders; Developing community standards for data and meta- data use and management in wildland fire research; Developing mechanisms to share information and ideas, such as bringing together disparate data sources including Earth observation data; Advancingwildland fire-related science and education through communication, data analysis, ideas sharing, novel collaborations, and workforce development. Particular areas of interest for FIRE-NETs include developing partnerships among groups that are not currently working together that might include multiple sectors, such as scientists from various disciplines, government representatives, resource managers, operational organizations, and community members.Small to large scale conference proposals that bring together different parts of the community to build a highly-functioning team are encouraged.",

        "description": "This competition is open only to the following Sea Grant programs in the northeast region - Maine Sea Grant, New Hampshire Sea Grant, MIT Sea Grant, Woods Hole Sea Grant, Connecticut Sea Grant, Rhode Island Sea Grant and New York Sea Grant. Proposals representing collaboration between multiple programs will be prioritized.The National Sea Grant College Program was enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1966 (amended in 2020, Public Law 116-221) to support leveraged federal and state partnerships that harness the intellectual capacity of the nation&#8217;s universities and research institutions to solve problems and generate opportunities in coastal communities.The National Sea Grant American Lobster Initiative began in 2018, in response to Congressional direction and with the recognition that a cohesive regional lobster program would be beneficial for the Northeast. Since then, the National Sea Grant Office (NSGO) has run competitions resulting in the funding of 40 research projects totaling more than $11.5 million, and awarding an additional $1.6 million in extension funding in the Northeast to transfer the research results to the decision makers and communities served.Pending federal appropriations in FY2025, consistent with its mission to enhance practical use and conservation in order to create a sustainable economy and environment, the NSGO intends to enhance local oversight and direction of research and extension within the American lobster fishery by funding a regional program that aims to synthesize previous and ongoing research findings, support new and ongoing place-based extension within the region, and continue addressing priority research needs necessary to enhance understanding of and address impacts on the significant, complex and dynamic American lobster fishery. A Gulf of Maine-focused, but regionally-coordinated American lobster program, will ensure that stakeholders across the Northeast region continue to benefit from research and extension supporting American lobster (Homarus americanus) and its fishery. This includes research carried out through the National Sea Grant American Lobster Initiative, state Sea Grant projects and other relevant research, as well as the lessons learned and best practices developed to benefit the sustainability of the fishery and its associated communities and economies.Given the maturity of existing regional extension programs and research projects, applications should highlight how the proposed scope of work will build on previous National Sea Grant American Lobster Initiative success and address emerging priorities impacting American lobster fishing communities in the region. Applications to this FY2025 Northeast American Lobster Regional Program competition should address the following objectives:Synthesis of past and ongoing American lobster research, especially that funded through the National Sea Grant American Lobster Initiative, including creation of communication and outreach products to convey and implement relevant findingsSupport for new and continuing place-based extension, outreach and education activitiesIdentification of needs and funding of competitive research following established NSGO competition policiesProvide for competition support and oversight of selected projectsProposals for the Northeast American Lobster Regional Program should support and coordinate with existing efforts while also seeking new partnerships that continue supporting a framework that facilitates regional coordination among its stakeholders. It is expected that applications will identify shared and complementary goals and strategies to leverage resources across the region and enable coordination among existing efforts. For example, the program should add value to and support relationships with related efforts among state and federal agency partners that advance the above objectives while continuing to fund research and building off the relationships with researchers. NOAA intends to use this NOFO to establish a partnership with a grantee to continue the successful activities of the National Sea Grant American Lobster Initiative, with the expectation that subsequent awards for continuing the established work (or new ones as appropriate) may be made on a noncompetitive &#8220;institutional&#8221; basis, based on satisfactory award performance, and continued relevance to program objectives as long as conditions of performance are met.All projects must take place within the United States or territories or their respective waterways.Applicant organizations must complete and maintain three registrations to be eligible to apply for or receive an award. These registrations include SAM.gov, Grants.gov, and eRA Commons. All registrations must be completed prior to the application being submitted. The complete registration process for all three systems can take 4 to 6 weeks, so applicants should begin this activity as soon as possible. If an eligible applicant does not have access to the internet, please contact the Agency Contacts listed in Section VII for submission instructions. NOAA has created a guide to aid applicants format application packages to eRA: Tips and Tricks for Successful eRA Submissions, linked here.Prior to registering with eRA Commons, applicant organizations must first obtain a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) from SAM.gov, if needed (refer to Section IV. Applications and Submission Information, Section C). Organizations can register with eRA Commons in tandem with completing their full SAM and Grants.gov registrations; however, all registrations must be in place by time of application submission. eRA Commons requires organizations to identify at least one Signing Official (SO) and at least one Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) account in order to submit an application.This document sets out requirements for submitting to NOAA-OAR-SG-2025-29639.",

        "description": "The purpose of this notice is to solicit financial assistance applications that will support state and national management goals through the creation of Sustainable Coral Reef Fisheries Management Plans (CR-FMPs) across the Hawaiian Islands. The applicant will work closely with partners at the State of Hawaii&#8217;s Division of Aquatic Resources (DAR) and NOAA Pacific Island Regional Office (PIRO) to support development of CR-FMPs as part of the State&#8217;s Holomua Initiative. The State will lead this process, driven by local, island-based Navigator Teams; this award will focus on providing technical support and creating decision-making tools to aid this process, and to support additional science needs to support future management decisions. These funds will be utilized specifically to support technical writing needs in Lana&#8216;i, Hawai&#8216;i Island, Kauai, and Oahu CR-FMPs, in coordination with DAR. CR-FMPs will identify specific management actions that will contribute to reaching locally identified sustainable fisheries management targets on each island, as well as developing monitoring and evaluation plans after CR-FMPs are complete. Additional funds will be used to support management driven scientific research that will directly advise the CR-FMPs. Applications submitted to this funding opportunity should propose work plans over a duration of no more than 36 months (3 years). Each application should not request more than $400,000 per priority, with a maximum of $600,000 in Federal funds. Applications are expected to be submitted by entities with a physical presence and long-term partnerships in Hawaii, and applicants should have demonstrated experience working across multiple partner types, such as government, nonprofit, and universities, and with Hawaiian organizations. Pending Federal appropriations, NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) expects approximately $600,000 to be available for initiating financial assistance awards for two (2) organizations in Fiscal Year (FY) 2025. As mandated in the Act, recipients are required to match NOAA&#8217;s Federal contributions with non-Federal matching contributions at a minimum ratio of 1:1, unless the applicant requests and is granted a waiver to the matching requirement by the agency. All projects must receive evidence of support (e.g., a letter of support or other indication of collaboration) by appropriate representatives of the State in which the project will be conducted.

        "description": "Summary: The fiscal year 2025 (FY25) Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Research Program (ALSRP) Therapeutic Development Award (TDA) supports research ranging from preclinical validation of therapeutic leads through Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies. The proposed studies are expected to be empirical in nature and product driven. Applicants with limited Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) experience are strongly encouraged to include collaborators with substantial experience in the relevant ALS model systems, endpoints, and pathophysiology. Applications supported by this award must begin with lead compounds in hand and must already demonstrate proof-of-concept efficacy data in at least one appropriate preclinical model system of ALS, including whole animal and cellular model systems. Distinctive Features: Mechanism-specific, predictive/cohort-selective, target engagement, and pharmacodynamic biomarker development, in parallel to the main therapeutic effort, is a critical component of the FY25 ALSRP Therapeutic Development Award. If appropriate mechanism-specific biomarkers are already available or currently in development, how the existing biomarkers will improve trial design, patient selection, and efficiency or interpretation of the proposed ALS therapeutic approach must be apparent in the application. Development of biomarkers for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, or measurement of general disease progression without consideration of the therapeutic development process will not be supported. Therapeutic candidates which have already been granted an IND are not appropriate for this mechanism",

All applications must address at least one of the fiscal year 2025 (FY25) Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP) overarching challenges, unless adequate justification for exception is provided. Applications must address the challenge in a way that can lead to or make a breakthrough and have major impact. The FY25 Breakthrough Award mechanism contains three different funding levels designed to support major (but not all) stages of research that will lead to clinical application. Each level has a defined research scope. The current program announcement discusses the Breakthrough Award Level 3.Distinctive Features:&#183; For this funding mechanism, small-scale clinical trials are allowed but not required. Applications proposing projects with a clinical trial should be submitted under the Clinical Trial option.&#183; The research team must include two or more breast cancer consumer advocates.&#183; This funding mechanism allows for a single Principal Investigator (PI), or two partnering PIs referred to as the Initiating PI and the Partnering PI. For the Partnering PI Option (PPIO), only the Initiating PI will submit a pre-application, but both PIs will need to submit at the full application stage. Be advised, applications may be withdrawn if both the initiating and partnering applications are not submitted by the full application deadline or if the initiating or partnering application is administratively withdrawn.",

Section 163 of the Revenue Act of 1978, Public Law No. 95-600, 92 Stat. 2810, November 6, 1978, authorizes this cooperative agreement. The Act authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to enter into agreements with private or public nonprofit agencies and organizations, which will provide training and technical assistance to volunteers who provide FREE tax counseling and assistance to elderly individuals in the preparation of their federal income tax returns. This Act authorizes an appropriation of special funds, in the form of grants, to provide tax assistance to persons age 60 years of age or older. The IRS receives the funds as a line item in the appropriation. The total funds are distributed to the grant recipients for their expenses. Eligible agencies and organizations compete for acceptance as a TCE grant recipient in compliance with the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977, Public Law No. 95-224, 92 Stat. 3, February 3, 1978, codified at 31 USC Chapter 63. Applicants must be experienced in coordinating volunteer programs, with experience in income tax return preparation. Eligible agencies and organizations receive grants to conduct local TCE Programs. Tax return preparation assistance is provided to elderly taxpayers during the usual period for filing federal income tax returns, which is from January 1 to April 15 each year. However, the program activities required to ensure that elderly taxpayers receive efficient and quality tax assistance can be conducted year-round. The application period for the program is May 1 through May 31 for organizations to submit their applications in grants.gov. Review and ranking occurs from June 1 through September 30 with notification of awards October 1.",

        "description": " The Public Diplomacy Section (PDS) at the U.S. Mission in Poland invites proposals for programs that strengthen U.S.-Poland ties by promoting bilateral cooperation and building lasting connections with emerging Polish leaders. Proposals should utilize American leadership, entrepreneurship, and workforce readiness best practices to equip high school students (ages 16 &#8211; 19) with essential soft skills&#8212;such as public speaking, critical thinking, self-management, an entrepreneurial mindset, risk-taking, presentation skills, and problem solving. Programs should also incorporate career guidance components to help youth confidently navigate the transition into adulthood, explore professional pathways, and make informed decisions about their futures. These initiatives should empower participants through practical tools and knowledge that reflect American models of education and career development, while fostering long-term engagement that supports shared democratic values and addresses the challenges of the modern workforce. Projects should empower participants to approach both personal and professional challenges with confidence, adaptability, and a proactive mindset. They should also foster lasting peer connections, mentorship networks, and sustained engagement beyond the program&#8217;s duration. Ultimately, all initiatives should focus on equipping youth with key soft skills essential for success in today&#8217;s job market, including public speaking, critical thinking, self-management, and problem solving. By strengthening these competencies, Polish high school students will grow into confident and resilient individuals who remain connected to U.S. values and approaches, supporting their continued personal growth and professional development&#8212;while advancing the long-term U.S.-Polish partnership. Awards will be made subject to the availability of appropriated funds and final selection. This NOFO is for projects beginning no earlier than September 30, 2025. The deadline for this NOFO is June 18, 2025. Please carefully follow all instructions below. A. Program Description 1. Goals and Objectives A successful proposal will include a comprehensive calendar of activities up to 18 months that includes a series of skills-building workshops and/or interactive trainings for high school students. All projects must address the development of youth leadership, critical thinking, project management skills, and resilience as well as career guidance activities. Proposals are encouraged to include the active involvement of U.S. business representatives, U.S. experts, alumni of U.S. government exchange programs, or other individuals with direct U.S. experience to provide real-world insights and mentorship that reflect American leadership in innovative approaches to entrepreneurship and career development. Engaging these stakeholders not only enriches the learning experience for participants but also showcases U.S. achievements in building competitive, skills-based career pathways. These connections help foster a deeper understanding of American values and practices and build long-term connections between Poland and the United States. By the end of the project, participants should demonstrate increased confidence and competence in key soft skills and a clearer understanding of potential career paths. The project should also result in tangible outcomes such as student presentations, project portfolios, or individual career action plans that reflect the skills and knowledge gained. All proposals are required to have a clear connection to the United States, either through U.S. organizations, experts, and/or best practices in order to increase the awareness and understanding of U.S. perspectives, policies, and society. Proposals without significant U.S. content will not be considered for funding. Examples of possible public diplomacy grant activities include, but are not limited to: &#183; Workshops, panels, and/or interactive sessions on public speaking, problem solving, critical thinking, and career planning. &#183; CV/Resume building clinics, mock interviews, and mentorship meet-ups with professionals. &#183; A series of guided sessions helping students explore career options through hands-on experiences, guest speakers, workplace visits, and practical exercises in self-presentation and goal setting. Participants and Audiences: Proposals should describe audiences for the program, including anticipated numbers to be reached. Applicants should be as specific as possible in their proposals about how their project&#8217;s primary audience will be recruited and how they will engage them through programming. Primary audiences are those who will participate directly in the program, while secondary audiences are those who will be reached by the project&#8217;s primary audiences as a result of their participation (for example, a workshop for high school students as primary audience could include elements of mentorship where teachers as a secondary audience may take a role of a facilitator or a mentor who would provide new ways to engage with students beyond traditional curricula). The principal method of engagement will be through in-person programming. Virtual engagement may be a part of the overall strategy, augmenting in-person programming. The following types of programs are NOT eligible for funding: &#183; Programs relating to partisan political activity; &#183; Charitable or development activities; &#183; Construction programs; &#183; Programs that support specific religious activities; &#183; Fund-raising campaigns; &#183; Lobbying for specific legislation or programs; &#183; Scientific research; &#183; Programs intended primarily for the growth or institutional development of the organization; or &#183; Programs that duplicate existing programs. This funding opportunity aims to support specific projects with objectives that can be achieved within a set timeframe. We will not accept applications that are aimed more broadly at supporting your organization&#8217;s usual or typical daily activities and operations. Those will be deemed technically ineligible and will not be considered for funding by the review committee. This notice is subject to availability of funding.",

The OCCTA will bring together established investigators (the Academy Dean and Assistant Dean), established Career Guides (mentors), and a group of ECIs/Scholars to conduct successful, highly productive clinical trials in ovarian cancer.Distinctive Features: Research funded under this FY25 funding opportunity will support translational research and small-scale, early-phase clinical trials in ovarian cancer. Preliminary data are required, however, these data do not necessarily need to be derived from the ovarian cancer research field. ECI must be within 12 years of last postdoctoral research position (Ph.D.), clinical fellowship (M.D.), or equivalent at the time of full application submission deadline. Must commit no less than 25% effort to this award and/or OCCTA activities for the first 2 years. The Designated Mentor must be a clinical trialist with a strong record of mentoring and training early-career investigators.",

        "description": "The Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) program seeks to enable funding opportunities that are flexible and responsive to the evolving and emerging needs in cyberinfrastructure (CI). The program continues to emphasize integrated CI services, quantitative metrics with targets for delivery and usage of these services, and community creation. The CSSI program anticipates three classes of awards: Elements: These awards target small groups that will create and deploy robust services for which there is a demonstrated need, and that will advance one or more significant areas of science and engineering. Framework Implementations: These awards target larger, interdisciplinary teams organized around the development and application of services aimed at solving common research problems faced by NSF researchers in one or more areas of science and engineering, and resulting in a sustainable community framework providing CI services to a diverse community or communities. Transition to Sustainability: These awards target groups who would like to execute a well-defined sustainability plan for existing CI with demonstrated impact in one or more areas of science and engineering supported by NSF. The sustainability plan should enable new avenues of support for the long-term sustained impact of the CI. NSF support for projects funded via CSSI Elements and Frameworks awards, or its predecessor programs, is intended to be of finite duration, limited to no more than 10 years. If appropriate for transition to sustainability, teams may request further one-time support through the &#8220;Transition to Sustainability&#8221; class of awards. Prospective Principal Investigators (PIs) should be aware that this is a multi-directorate activity and that they are encouraged to submit proposals with broad, interdisciplinary interests. Further, not all divisions are participating at the same level, and division-specific priorities differ. Prospective PIs should also refer to the directorate/division-specific descriptions contained in Section II of this solicitation. Finally, it is strongly recommended that prospective PIs contact program officer(s) from the list of Cognizant Program Officers in the division(s) that typically support the scientists and engineers who would make use of the proposed work, to gain insight into the priorities for the relevant areas of science and engineering to which their proposals should be responsive. As part of contacting Cognizant Program Officers, prospective PIs are also encouraged to ascertain that the focus and budget of their proposed work are appropriate for this solicitation.",

To date, the COPS Office has been appropriated more than $21 billion to advance community policing, including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring and redeployment of nearly 140,000 officers. COPS Office information resources, covering a wide range of community policing topics such as school and campus safety, violent crime, and officer safety and wellness, can be downloaded via the COPS Office&#8217;s home page, https://cops.usdoj.gov. The FY25 School Violence Prevention Program (SVPP) provides funding directly to states, units of local government, Indian tribes, and their public agencies to improve security at schools and on school grounds in the recipient&#8217;s jurisdiction through evidence-based school safety programs. The COPS Office anticipates that up to $73,000,000 will be available for up to $500,000 per award, with approximately 200 awards anticipated. A local cost share (matching funds) of at least 25 percent in the form of cash is required unless a match waiver is requested and approved, and the period of performance duration will be 36 months, with a period of performance start date of 10/1/25. Approximately $1 million of the available funding will be reserved for microgrants for school districts, including rural, tribal, and low-resourced schools. Applications for microgrants must not exceed $100,000, and the COPS Office will waive the 25 percent local cost share (matching funds) requirement for microgrant applicants that are selected for funding. Consideration for microgrant funding does not exclude your agency from consideration from non-microgrant SVPP funding. Applications should demonstrate a comprehensive approach to school safety and activities must fall within one of the statutory purpose areas (see 34 U.S.C. &#167; 10551(b)(5)&#8211;(9)): &#8226; Coordination with local law enforcement; &#8226; Training for local law enforcement officers to prevent student violence against others and self; &#8226; Placement and use of metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other deterrent measures; &#8226; Acquisition and installation of technology for expedited notification of local law enforcement during an emergency; &#8226; Any other measure that, in the determination of the COPS Office Director, may provide a significant improvement in security.",

        "description": "MATHEMATICS IS THE SOURCE OF SIGNIFICANT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES; HOWEVER, PROGRESS IN MATH IS SLOW. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) suggest the possibility of increasing the rate of progress in mathematics. Still, a wide gap exists between state-of-the-art AI capabilities and pure mathematics research. Advances in mathematics are slow for two reasons. First, decomposing problems into useful lemmas is a laborious and manual process. To advance the field of mathematics, mathematicians use their knowledge and experience to explore candidate lemmas, which, when composed together, prove theorems. Ideally, these lemmas are generalizable beyond the specifics of the current problem so they can be easily understood and ported to new contexts. Second, proving candidate lemmas is slow, effortful, and iterative. Putative proofs may have gaps, such as the one in Wiles&#8217; original proof of Fermat&#8217;s last theorem, which necessitated more than a year of additional work to fix. In theory, formalization in programming languages, such as Lean, could help automate proofs, but translation from math to code and back remains exceedingly difficult. The significant recent advances in AI fall short of the automated decomposition or auto(in)formalization challenges. Decomposition in formal settings is currently a manual process, as seen in the Prime number theorem and beyond and the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa conjecture, with existing tools, such as Blueprint for Lean, only facilitating the structuring of math and code. Auto(in)formalization is an active area of research in the AI literature, but current approaches show poor performance and have not yet advanced to even graduate-level textbook problems. Formal languages with automated theorem-proving tools, such as Lean and Isabelle, have traction in the community for problems where the investment in manual formalization is worth it. The goal of expMath is to radically accelerate the rate of progress in pure mathematic",

        "description": "The U.S. Embassy in Amman is announcing an open competition for not-for-profit organizations registered in Jordan or the United States to promote in Jordan the United States as the premier destination for higher education. The organization should arrange a two-day EducationUSA Fair in October 2025. This fair will serve as a premier higher education event, connecting Jordanian students, parents, and high school counselors with representatives from 25-30 accredited U.S. universities. The organization will also develop and produce a digital campaign to foster interest in U.S. higher-education opportunities.According to the latest Open Doors Report, Jordanian student enrollment at U.S. universities is at its highest level in 30 years. This milestone underscores the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Jordan, the increasing demand for U.S. higher education, and the vital role of strengthening academic partnerships between the two countries. The United States recognizes the importance of Jordanian students choosing the United States as the country to pursue higher education, which accounts for $115 million dollars in revenue annually to the U.S. economy, making the United States more prosperous.",

To date, the COPS Office has been appropriated more than $21 billion to advance community policing, including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local, territorial, and tribal law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring and redeployment of nearly 140,000 officers. COPS Office information resources, covering a wide range of community policing topics such as school and campus safety, violent crime, and officer safety and wellness, can be downloaded via the COPS Office&#8217;s home page, https://cops.usdoj.gov. The FY25 COPS Hiring Program (CHP) provides funding to law enforcement agencies to hire and/or rehire additional career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. As community policing is common sense policing, throughout the CHP Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) materials, the terms &#8216;community policing&#8217; and &#8216;common sense policing&#8217; are used interchangeably, unless otherwise specified. Anticipated outcomes of CHP awards include engagement in planned community partnerships, implementation of projects to analyze and assess problems, implementation of changes to personnel and agency management in support of community policing, and increased capacity of agency to engage in community policing activities.&#8239;&#8239;Community policing is a philosophy that promotes organizational strategies that support the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to proactively address the immediate conditions that give rise to public safety issues such as violent crime, nonviolent crime, and fear of crime.",

        "description": "The Science of Science:Discovery, Communication and Impact (SoS:DCI) program is designed to advance theory and knowledge about increasing the public value of scientific activity. Science of Science draws from multiple disciplinary and field perspectives to advance theory and research about scientific discovery, communication and impact. SoS:DCI welcomes proposals applying rigorous empirical research methods to advance theory and knowledge on: The social and structural mechanisms of scientific discovery. Theories, frameworks, models and data that improve our understanding of scientific communication and outcomes. The societal benefits of scientific activity and how science advances evidence-based policy making and the creation of public value. The SoS:DCI program, which expands upon the formerScience of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP)program, funds research that builds theoretical and empirical understanding of the social science of science. SoS:DCI welcomes proposals to conduct research at the individual, organizational and institutional levels or from micro, meso and macro scales and complex system levels. SoS:DCI encourages multiple disciplinary perspectives, interdisciplinary research and diverse methodological approaches in the pursuit of new knowledge to advance the science of science and evidence-based policy making. With these goals in mind, proposals should: Draw from and advance theory, knowledge and frameworks on the science of science. Develop models, data, indicators and associated analytical tools that constitute and enable transformative advances rather than incremental change. Provide credible rigorous assessments of the proposed project&#8217;s impact and social and policy implications. Include robust data management plans with the goal of advancing open science and increasing public access to usable, valid and reliable scientific materials. Of particular interest are proposals with the potential to strengthen America&#8217;s global leadership in science and increase national competitiveness across a broad range of domains. These include proposals that analyze strategies for strengthening and expanding the scientific workforce, as well as ways to cultivate high-impact discovery across sectors.The program strongly encourages convergent research and collaboration. In addition to intellectual merit, the program strongly encourages potential PIs to carefully consider the broader impacts of their work. The broader impacts criterion encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired policy outcomes.The Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate has released additional guidance on broader impacts for SBE proposals. The SoS:DCI program places a high priority on broadening participation in the sciences. It encourages proposals from early-career researchers and from researchers who represent groups and regions that have historically participated at disproportionately low rates in science, mathematics, and engineering. SoS:DCI supports the following types of proposals: Standard Research Grants and Grants for Collaborative Research A Science of Science Approach to Analyzing and Innovating the Biomedical Research Enterprise (SoS:BIO) Conference Grants SoS:DCI also participates in certain specialized funding opportunities through NSF&#8217;s cross-cutting and cross-directorate activities.",

This Annual Program Statement outlines our funding priorities, the Program&#8217;s strategic themes, and the procedures for submitting requests for funding. &#8239;Please carefully follow all instructions below. Purpose of Public Diplomacy Grants:&#8239; Embassy Budapest invites proposals for programs that strengthen ties between the American and Hungarian people through programming that highlights shared values, mutual prosperity, and bilateral cooperation. All projects must include an American component to be eligible for funding. An American component can mean an American cultural element, or connection with American experts, organizations, or institutions in a specific field that will promote increased understanding of U.S. policy and perspectives. Examples include: - An American citizen who is an expert, speaker, artist, athlete, or other visitor to Hungary who will lead or present some key component of the project. - The use of an American cultural product as a major touchstone for key elements of the program. Cultural products could include books, music, curricula, films, or technology created entirely or primarily by American innovators and clearly associated with American excellence. - Engaging audiences in learning about or practicing a major American topic, such as U.S. policy, U.S. history, or American values as a significant focus of the program. Priority Program Areas in FY2025: Proposals should clearly state how the project will make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous and should respond to at least one of the following thematic priorities: a) Highlighting the mutual prosperity generated by the U.S.-Hungarian economic relationship and increasing awareness of America&#8217;s role as an economic and trade partner to Hungary b) Celebrating American excellence through programs highlighting America&#8217;s scientific leadershi",

Surveys find that currently 11.2 percent of the Jordanian population over the age of five has a disability. Although the government passed the &quot;Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&quot; in 2017 and mandated that at least one percent of ministries&apos; total annual budgets be allocated to ensure programs and services are accessible to persons with disabilities, government funding remains insufficient to address the needs of PWDs. NGOs report many PWDs are stigmatized, ostracized, and are not recognized for their capabilities and their potential to live full lives. Families, fearing that their children will face discrimination in school, choose to keep their children at home, leading to 79 percent of school-aged people with disabilities not enrolled in any educational institution. The lack of access to education has lifelong consequences. One third of illiterate Jordanians aged 13 and older are PWDs, and around 84 percent of working age people with disabilities of in Jordan are unemployed. Thanks to the passage of the American with Disabilities Act in 1990, the United States is a world leader in protecting and promoting the civil rights of PWDs. Partnering Jordanian organizations with American institutions will showcase America&#8217;s global leadership, provide Jordanians with an authentic glimpse into America&#8217;s achievements on protecting the civil rights of PWDs, and create bonds between American and Jordanian communities. The Empowered Parents In Charge (EPIC) program will celebrate American excellence by spotlighting the achievements of specific Americans while offering best practices about and sharing aspects of the American experience to equip Jordanian parents of children with disabilities with advocacy skills, legal frameworks, financial resources, and civic engagement training. Parents will be empowered to ensure their children remain in school, are prepared for employment opportunities, and ultimately contribute to Jordan&apos;s economic growth and stability, thus reinforcing Jordan as a reliable regional partner to advance U.S. interests. Finally, the EPIC program will demonstrate how American excellence in the science, technology, and artificial intelligence (AI) arenas have benefited PWDs and explore ways Jordanians could apply such innovations to advocating and supporting PWDs.

This Notice of Funding Opportunity seeks applicants for the Critical Response and Organizational Assessment programs only. Applicants wishing to be considered for both Critical Response and Organizational Assessment must submit a separate application for each program. The COPS Office is not seeking competitive proposals for CRI-TAC in FY25. The COPS Office welcomes applications under which two or more entities would carry out the federal award; however, only one entity may be the applicant. Any other entities carrying out the federal award must be identified as proposed subrecipients. The applicant must be the entity that would have primary responsibility for carrying out the awards, including administering the funding, managing the entire project and monitoring compliance. The terms and conditions of the federal award are also applicable to subrecipients. Please note the distinction between a subaward that creates a financial assistance relationship to carry out a portion of the federal award and a contract that creates a procurement relationship for the purchase of goods and services needed under the federal award. To assist in making subrecipient and contractor determinations, please refer to the guidance in 2 C.F.R. &#167; 200.331. All future awards will comply with Executive Orders and Attorney General memoranda to advance the Administration&#8217;s priority of reestablishing law and order to include the increased hiring and retention of state and local sworn officers, state and local law enforcement collaboration with federal task forces, cracking down on the open use of illegal drugs, interrupting the distribution of fentanyl and other dangerous drugs, preventing crime, promoting nuisance abatement, countering human trafficking and child smuggling, and enhanced immigration enforcement and border security. All awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and any modifications or additional requirements that may be imposed by law.

        "description": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: VA is announcing the availability of funds for suicide prevention grants under the Staff Sergeant Fox Suicide Prevention Grant Program(SSG Fox SPGP). The SSG Fox SPGP directs efforts to reduce Veteran suicide by awarding grants to community-based organizations to provide or coordinate the provision of primarily non-clinical suicide prevention services, including outreach and linkage to VA and community resources, to eligible individuals and their families.The SSG Fox SPGP furthers VA&apos;s public health approach to suicide prevention by combining community-based efforts with linkage to clinical care to prevent Veteran suicide for those inside and outside of VA health care. The goal of these grants is to reduce Veteran suicide risk by improving mental health status, well-being, financial stability, and social support for eligible individuals and their families.Eligible applicants are organizations that meet the definition of an eligible entity in section 201(q)(3) of the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act of 2019 (Hannon Act), codified at 38 U.S.C. &#167; 1720F note. These may include incorporated private institutions or foundations for which no part of the net earnings incur to the benefit of any individual and that have a governing board responsible for the operation of the suicide prevention services provided under the SSG Fox SPGP; corporations wholly owned by incorporated private institutions or foundations meeting the requirements listed above; Indian tribes; community-based organizations that can effectively network with local civic organizations, regional health systems, and other settings where eligible individuals and their families are likely to have contact; and state or local governments.This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) assumes that Congress will extend the authority and appropriate funds consistent with section 201 of the Hannon Act as currently written. The NOFO contains information concerning the SSG Fox SPGP; the renewal and new suicide prevention grant application processes; and the amount of funding available. Awards made for suicide prevention grants will fund operationsPage 3 of 15 beginning on September 30, 2025, if the authority granted by section 201 of the Hannon Act is extended and funds are appropriated. This is a one-year award with the option to renew for an additional year, pending availability of funds and grantee performance. For detailed program information and requirements, see part 78 of title 38, Code of Federal Regulations (38 CFR part 78).",

In 2015, Congress passed the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act, named in honor of two New York City police officers killed in an ambush attack on December 20, 2014. The act directs the Department of Justice (DOJ) to establish a voluntary nationwide system to give authorities an early warning of threats against law enforcement and to aid in the apprehension of suspects who have killed or seriously injured an officer or deputy, and finding an officer when they are missing in connection with their official duties. In 2016, the COPS Office was given the honor of implementing the act and established the National Blue Alert Network. The primary objectives of the cooperative agreement to be funded under this notice of funding opportunity are to support states participating in the National Blue Alert Network and to raise awareness, educate, and inform non-Blue Alert states of the Blue Alert Network (e.g., production of an educational video, factsheets, newsletters, presentations, etc.), provide monthly summaries of Blue Alert activations throughout the country, including detailed accounts of heroism involving Blue Alert events, and research, gather, and compile accurate and timely information, from credible sources, about all reported incidents where on duty law enforcement throughout the United States, territories, and tribal lands are shot in the line of duty.

The COPS Office welcomes applications under which two or more entities would carry out the federal award; however, only one entity may be the applicant. Any other entities carrying out the federal award must be identified as proposed subrecipients. The applicant must be the entity that would have primary responsibility for carrying out the awards, including administering the funding, managing the entire project and monitoring compliance. The terms and conditions of the federal award are also applicable to subrecipients. Please note the distinction between a subaward that creates a financial assistance relationship to carry out a portion of the federal award and a contract that creates a procurement relationship for the purchase of goods and services needed under the federal award. To assist in making subrecipient and contractor determinations, please refer to the guidance in 2 C.F.R. &#167; 200.331. All future awards will comply with Executive Orders and Attorney General memoranda to advance the Administration&#8217;s priority of reestablishing law and order to include the increased hiring and retention of state and local sworn officers, state and local law enforcement collaboration with federal task forces, cracking down on the open use of illegal drugs, interrupting the distribution of fentanyl and other dangerous drugs, preventing crime, promoting nuisance abatement, countering human trafficking and child smuggling, and enhanced immigration enforcement and border security. All awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and any modifications or additional requirements that may be imposed by law.

        "description": "The VINES program seeks to support both fundamental research and verticals-driven technology development, demonstration, and translation activities that will lead to leaps in performance and capabilities of next generation (NextG) advanced intelligent network systems that span the user-edge-core-cloud continuum. The program seeks to go beyond the current research portfolios within individual participating NSF directorates and partner organizations by simultaneously emphasizing gains in performance and capabilities without compromising resilience and interoperability across all layers of the networking protocol and computation stacks. Innovations are sought across the various aspects of next generation communications, networking, and computing systems. This program is a multisector effort led by the National Science Foundation (NSF), in partnership with several industry and international agency partners, and in cooperation with other U.S. Federal agencies. It recognizes the importance of advanced telecommunications as a key technology area. The program seeks to enhance U.S. competitiveness in advanced telecommunications technologies to establish itself as a global leader in both NextG wireless telecommunications and emerging potential NextG vertical industries, as well as address the need for skilled workforce and expertise in these technology areas. VINES expects to increase investments in foundational technology innovations and their translation while leveraging international eco-system partners to drive the principles of open and trustworthy networks. It seeks to fund collaborative research that transcends the traditional boundaries of individual disciplines or geographic boundaries to achieve the program goals. This program is organized into two Tracks: &#183; Track 1 (Use-inspired Fundamental Research) will support activities focused on use-inspired fundamental research to develop novel networking techniques and solutions. &#183; Track 2 (Verticals-Driven Technology Development, Demonstration, and Translation) will support activities focused on technology development, maturation, demonstration, integration, and translation of solutions with higher technology readiness levels (TRLs), with the goal of producing adoption-ready technologies. Industry contributions will not be used to fund Track 2. Companies specifically listed in this solicitation have committed to providing annual unrestricted donations to NSF for the purpose of funding proposals in Track 1. The reference to &#8220;industry partners&#8221; in this document refers specifically to Ericsson, Intel, and Qualcomm in their role as funding partners in this solicitation. The donations from these partners have been agreed upon based on a shared belief in the importance of advancing use-inspired fundamental research, education, and workforce development goals identified in Track 1. In the spirit of a whole-of-government approach, the collaborating U.S. Federal agencies listed on this solicitation, NIST, OUSD (R&amp;E), and DHS, referred to as &#8220;Federal partners,&#8221; have participated in the development of this solicitation. NIST, OUSD (R&amp;E), and DHS intend to consider co-funding proposals subject to availability of funds. Proposals will be recommended for funding in accordance with the NSF Selection Process described below. The collaborating U.S. agencies may consider funding or co-funding of proposals from either track in this solicitation. Any funds transferred from these partners to NSF will be combined with NSF and other partner funds where applicable to make awards under this program. These awards are made and managed at NSF. As the NextG networks eco-system is global, this program also partners with international agencies to advance research and accelerate technology translation in the spirit of principles and values outlined in the February 26, 2024, &#8220;Joint Statement Endorsing Principles for 6G: Secure, Open, and Resilient by Design.&#8221; International funding agencies listed in this solicitation, referred to as &#8220;international partners,&#8221; from Finland, India, Japan, and Sweden have participated in the development of this solicitation.This program seeks proposals formed entirely by U.S. funded teams, as well as international collaborative proposals formed by U.S. and international partner funded teams. Personnel requestingfundingfrom international partners on international collaborative proposals are referred to as foreign collaborators.For international collaborative proposals, this program supports bi-lateral international projects with the U.S., i.e., projects seeking funding from the U.S. in partnership with only one of the participating international partners.Proposals will be recommended for funding in accordance with the NSF Selection Process described below. International collaborative proposals are expected to have the international team funded by the respective international partner.

All future awards will comply with Executive Orders and Attorney General memoranda to advance the Administration&#8217;s priority of reestablishing law and order to include the increased hiring and retention of state and local sworn officers, state and local law enforcement collaboration with federal task forces, cracking down on the open use of illegal drugs, interrupting the distribution of fentanyl and other dangerous drugs, preventing crime, promoting nuisance abatement, countering human trafficking and child smuggling, and enhanced immigration enforcement and border security. All awards are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and any modifications or additional requirements that may be imposed by law. As community policing is common sense policing, throughout the NOFO materials, the terms &#8216;community policing&#8217; and &#8216;common sense policing&#8217; are used interchangeably, unless otherwise specified.",

The CREST program, composed of the CREST Centers, the CREST Postdoctoral Research Program, and the projects supported by this CREST-RISE solicitation, promotes the development of new knowledge, enhancements of the research productivity of individual faculty and postdoctoral scholars, and an expanded presence of research doctoral students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines, especially those from underrepresented groups. CREST-RISE is the component of the CREST program that supports the expansion of institutional research capacity by increasing the strength of institutional graduate programs and the successful production of research doctoral students, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM. The CREST-RISE component supports STEM research doctoral programs in all NSF supported areas and encourages proposals in areas of national interest, such as artificial intelligence, data science and analytics; advanced materials, manufacturing, robotics; cybersecurity; plant genetics/agricultural technologies; quantum information sciences; nanotechnology, semiconductors/microelectronics technologies; climate change and clean energy. CREST-RISE projects must have a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department(s) and the institution&#8217;s strategic plan and mission. Project plans should emphasize activities designed to increase the production of research doctoral students, especially those underrepresented in STEM as well as expand institutional research capacity. The goals of CREST-RISE are to increase: 1) the number of STEM research doctoral programs at MSIs (as defined in the Eligibility section), 2) the number of STEM research doctoral students graduating from MSIs, especially those from groups underrepresented in STEM, and 3) institutional research capacity to increase doctoral students&#8217; graduation rates.To achieve these goals, the CREST-RISE program includes three tracks as follows: CREST-RISE STEM Doctoral Programs Support Initiative (CREST-RISE DPSI) CREST-RISE Research Advancement and Development (CREST-RISE RAD) CREST-RISE Equipment &amp; Instrumentation (CREST-RISE E&amp;I) ",

Communications and networking technologies that can provide seamless, robust, connectivity are key enablers for the NTG. These technologies will be deployed on a variety of platforms, both manned and unmanned, operating under challenging environmental and operational warfare conditions (lack of infrastructure, mobility, spectrum limitations, interference, multipath, atmospherics, jamming, electronic intercept, size/weight/power constraint, etc.) in different domains (land, maritime [includes both surface and undersea], cyber, and space). Successful Command and Control (C2) and decision making, at all levels of command, for DMO is critically dependent on these communications and networking technologies.",

        "description": "Organizations -- private and public, established and entrepreneurial, designed and emergent, formal and informal, profit and nonprofit -- are critical to the well-being of nations and their citizens. They are of crucial importance for producing goods and services, creating value, providing jobs, and achieving social goals. The Science of Organizations (SoO) program funds basic research that yields a scientific evidence base for improving the design and emergence, development and deployment, and management and ultimate effectiveness of organizations of all kinds. SoO funds research that advances our fundamental understanding of how organizations develop, form and operate. Successful SoO research proposals use scientific methods to develop and refine theories, to empirically test theories and frameworks, and to develop new measures and methods. Funded research is aimed at yielding generalizable insights that are of value to the business practitioner, policy-maker and research communities. SoO welcomes any and all rigorous, scientific approaches that illuminate aspects of organizations as systems of coordination, management and governance. In considering whether a particular project might be a candidate for consideration by SoO, please note: Intellectual perspectives may involve (but are not limited to) organizational theory, behavior, sociology or economics, business policy and strategy, communication sciences, entrepreneurship, human resource management, information sciences, managerial and organizational cognition, operations management, public administration, social or industrial psychology, and technology and innovation management. Phenomena studied may include (but are not limited to) structures, routines, effectiveness, competitiveness, innovation, dynamics, change and evolution.Levels of analysis may include (but are not limited to) organizational, cross-organizational collaborations or relationships, and institutional and can address individuals, groups or teams.Research methods may be qualitative and quantitative and may include (but are not limited to) archival analyses, surveys, simulation studies, experiments, comparative case studies, and network analyses. Consistent with NSF merit review criteria, each SoO proposal should discuss both the intellectual merit and the potential broader impacts of the proposed research. SoO values basic research that has the potential to provide broader societal benefits. However, the majority of space in any proposal will need to be dedicated to the explication of theory, methods, and specific contribution to the evidence base about organizational effectiveness. Projects that aim to implement and subsequently evaluate particular organizational training, effectiveness or change programs, rather than to advance fundamental, generalizable knowledge, are not appropriate for SoO. Researchers who seek to conduct SoO-appropriate research in an industrial site and/or via an industry-university collaboration are invited to also look at the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) program web site.",

The Big Ideas represent unique opportunities to position our Nation at the cutting edge of global science and engineering leadership by bringing together diverse disciplinary perspectives to support convergence research. As such, when responding to this solicitation, even though proposals must be submitted to the Directorate for STEM Education (EDU) / Division of Equity for Excellence in STEM (EES), once received, the proposals will be managed by a cross-disciplinary team of NSF Program Directors. The INCLUDESInitiative is a comprehensive, national effort to enhance U.S. leadership in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) discovery and innovation, focused on NSF&#8217;s commitment to ensuring accessibility and inclusivity in STEM fields, as communicated in the NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2022 - 2026. The vision of the INCLUDES Initiative is to catalyze the STEM enterprise to work collaboratively for inclusive change, resulting in a STEM workforce that reflects the Nation&#8217;s population. More specifically, the INCLUDES Initiative seeks to motivate and accelerate collaborative infrastructure building to sustain systemic change to broaden participation in STEM fields at scale.Significant advancement of the INCLUDES Initiative&apos;s goalswill result in a new generation of STEM talent and leadership to secure the Nation&#8217;s future and long-term economic competitiveness. With this solicitation, NSF offers support for five types of projects that connect and contribute to the National Network: (1) Design and Development Launch Pilots, (2) Collaborative Change Consortia, (3) Alliances, (4) Network Connectors, and (5) Conferences. The INCLUDES National Network is a multifaceted collaboration of agencies, organizations, and individuals working collectively to broaden participation in STEM. The INCLUDES National Network serves as a testbed for designing, implementing, studying, refining, and scaling collaborative change modelsand is composed of: INCLUDES funded projects Other NSF funded projects Subcommittee on Federal Coordination in STEM Education (FC-STEM) agencies Scholars engaged in broadening participation research and evaluation, and Organizations that support the development of talent from all sectors of society to build an inclusive STEM workforce. All INCLUDES funded projects must operationalize five design elements of collaborative infrastructure - (1) shared vision, (2) partnerships, (3) goals and metrics, (4) leadership and communication, and (5) expansion, sustainability, and scale- to create systemic change that broadens participation in STEM.

        "description": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program invests in the Nation&apos;s colleges and universities to aid student success to create a new generation of STEM discoverers for the national STEM enterprise. The program takes a comprehensive approach to the STEM Learning Ecosystem to impact STEM student development and retention. LSAMP is an alliance-based program, whereby a group of institutions of higher education (IHEs) work together to diversify the nation&apos;s science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by increasing the number of STEM baccalaureate and graduate degrees awarded to persons from LSAMP populations. LSAMP populations are defined as persons from groups underrepresented in the STEM enterprise: Blacks and African-Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. The LSAMP program provides funding to alliances that implement comprehensive, evidence-based, innovative, and sustained strategies that ultimately result in the graduation of well-prepared, highly competitive students from LSAMP populations who pursue graduate studies or careers in STEM, while also supporting knowledge generation, knowledge utilization, assessment of program impacts, dissemination activities and dissemination of scholarly research into the field. Projects supported by the LSAMP program include: --Alliance Development Grants (ADG) support the conceptualization and development of new B2B and new SPIO alliances. (New) --Bridge-to-the-Baccalaureate (B2B) alliances facilitate the successful transfer of students from LSAMP populations to four-year institutions in pursuit of STEM baccalaureate degrees. --STEM Pathways Implementation-Only (SPIO) alliances are designed for new and reconstituted alliances. These projects focus on building and strengthening strategies and approaches to assist Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) increase STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitate entry into STEM graduate degree programs. --STEM Pathways Research Alliances (SPRA) are designed for well-established alliances. These projects serve as models of excellence in STEM broadening participation by (1) steadily increasing STEM baccalaureate degrees to LSAMP populations and facilitating entry into STEM graduate degree programs; (2) producing and disseminating new scholarly research on the broadening participation of LSAMP populations (or underrepresented and underserved populations in STEM disciplines and the nation&apos;s STEM workforce) and, (3) holistically assess the state of institutionalization and sustainability of the alliance. --Bridge to STEM Graduate Degrees in National Priorities (BD-Master&apos;s) projects support cohorts of six graduate students pursuing a M. S. degree in STEM national priority areas, providing financial support (stipends and cost of education) and support to help develop and maintain academic and research skills that enable participants to successfully persist in STEM graduate degree programs at Master&apos;s comprehensive-degree producing institutions only. (New) --Bridge to STEM Graduate Degrees in National Priorities (BD-Doctoral) projects support cohorts of twelve graduate students pursuing a Ph.D. degree in STEM national priority areas, providing financial support (stipends and cost of education) and support to help develop and maintain academic and research skills that enable participants to successfully persist in STEM doctoral degree programs. --STEM Networking Incentives and Engagement (NETWORKS) projects provide support to incentivize the creation and participation of LSAMP populations in STEM networks.

        "description": "Program Mission: The IUCRC program catalyzes breakthrough pre-competitive research by enabling close and sustained engagement between industry innovators, world-class academic teams, and government agencies. IUCRCs help industry partners and government agencies connect directly and efficiently with university researchers to achieve three primary objectives:1) Conduct high-impact research to meet shared and critical industrial needs in companies of all sizes; 2) Enhance U.S. global leadership in driving innovative technology development, and 3) Identify, mentor and develop a highly skilled science and engineering workforce. Program Overview: The IUCRC program provides a structure for academic researchers to conduct fundamental, pre-competitive research of shared interest to industry and government organizations. These organizations pay membership fees to a consortium so that they can collectively envision and fund research, with at least 90% of Member funds allocated to the direct costs of these shared research projects. IUCRCs are formed around research areas of strategic interest to U.S. industry.Industry is defined very broadly to include companies (large and small), startups and non-profit organizations. Principal Investigators form a Center around emerging research topics of current research interest, in a pre-competitive space but with clear pathways to applied research and commercial development.Industry partners join at inception, as an existing Center grows or they inspire the creation of a new Center by recruiting university partners to leverage NSF support.Government agencies participate in IUCRCs as Members or by partnering directly with NSF at the strategic level. Universities, academic researchers, and students benefit from IUCRC participation through the research funding, the establishment and growth of industry partnerships, and educational and career placement opportunities for students. Industry Members benefit by accessing knowledge, facilities, equipment, and intellectual property in a highly cost-efficient model; leveraging Center research outcomes in their future proprietary projects; interacting in an informal, collaborative way with other private sector and government entities with shared interests; and identifying and recruiting talent. NSF provides funding to support Center administrative costs and a governance framework to manage membership, operations, and evaluation. Successful IUCRCs require: A capable research/management team with an entrepreneurial mindset; Universities, faculty, and students interested in engaging in research of interest to industry; A community of industry partners seeking pre-competitive, use-inspired research projects. Each IUCRC is expected to grow and become independently sustainable by the end of the NSF support.",
