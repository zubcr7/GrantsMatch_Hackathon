    "bio": "Gunnar Lucko, Ph.D., M.ASCE is Ordinary Professor of Civil Engineering at Catholic University of America (CUA) and is Director of its Construction Engineering and Management Program, which is a specialization within the undergraduate and graduate studies in civil engineering. He has been a full-time faculty since 2005 and was promoted and tenured in 2011 and promoted in 2016. He received his Doctor of Philosophy as a Vecellio Graduate Fellow from the Vecellio Construction Engineering and Management Program at Virginia Tech in 2003 and a Master of Science as a Fulbright Scholar in the same program in 1999. He also holds a diploma (Diploma-Engineer = Dipl.-Ing.) equivalent to a Master's degree with concentrations in structural and environmental engineering from Hamburg University of Technology in his native Germany. His scholarship has been recognized with the 2017 Provost Award for Achievement in Research, the 2013 Daniel W. Halpin Award for Scholarship in Construction of ASCE, and the 2011 Thomas Fitch Rowland Prize of ASCE (which he shares with Dr. Rojas) for their journal paper on validation methods. The School of Engineering awarded him the 2013 Charles H. Kaman Award for Research Excellence and 2010 Burns Junior Faculty Fellowship. He has also received the 2009 Provost Award for Teaching Excellence in Early Career Faculty and the 2008 Kaman Award for Teaching Excellence. His SPEED ( Schedule Performance for Efficient and Effective Delivery ) lab focuses on modeling, analysis, and optimization of project schedules in conjunction with other quantitative aspects, e.g. costs and resource use, using innovative formulations and graphics, as well as studying construction equipment operations and economics. He has published over 50 peer-reviewed journal papers, over 70 conference papers, and one industry standard (ASTM E3372-23) on these topics. A major focus of his work is the novel application of singularity functions, which originated in structural engineering, to construction management. His current work continues to expand the capabilities of these flexible functions. Another growing area of interest are applications of game theory to construction project management challenges, from bidding to claims. He is Associate Editor and active reviewer of the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management, Past Chair of the Executive Committee of the Construction Research Council (CRC) in ASCE's Construction Institute and has served on technical committees of numerous conferences. From 2006 to 2009 he was principal investigator for a funded collaborative project of the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance and the Engineers Without Borders national capital chapter. Its unique student-centered team of undergraduate students, faculty, and industry assembled expertise in construction, structural, and earthquake engineering to develop a low-cost sustainable foundation damper system for structures in developing regions. The team then traveled to a community in rural El Salvador and successfully implemented the design in a health clinic building that now serves this community. He has also volunteered for CUA summer youth programs, e.g. Keys to Empowering Youth and Eye on Engineering. Since 2005, he is a biweekly mentor for a group of local minority high schoolers through the national Career Directions for Students in Architecture, Construction, and Engineering (ACE) Program.",

    "bio": "Reservoir Computing: (with Francesco Sorrentino, Chandra Pappu, Chad Nathe, Thomas Carrol, Lou Pecora) Reservoir computing is a type of computational model that is used for solving a wide range of problems, including machine learning, signal processing, and time series analysis. In a reservoir computing system, a large, interconnected network of simple processing units, known as a \"reservoir,\" is used to perform the computation. The key advantage of this approach is that the reservoir can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks using a single, fixed set of weights, which makes it highly flexible and efficient. This makes reservoir computing an attractive approach for many applications, especially those that require the ability to quickly and easily adapt to changing conditions. In this research the collaboration is looking at various impacts of the implementation of reservoir computers including the impact of noise and the possibility of applying control to the input to achieve a desired output. Models for Crack Branching and Multifractal statistics of Crack Branching: (with John Mecholsky, Jr., Stephen Freiman, and Roman Mecholsky) Models for crack branching are important for a variety of reasons. First, understanding the behavior of cracks as they branch and spread is essential for predicting the strength and durability of materials. This information is critical for the design and construction of safe and reliable structures, such as bridges, buildings, and aircraft. Second, studying crack branching can provide insight into the underlying physical processes that govern the behavior of materials, which can help to improve our understanding of how materials respond to various types of stress and strain. Finally, models of crack branching can be used to develop new materials and manufacturing processes that are more resistant to cracking and other forms of failure. Here the collaboration is interested in various aspects of crack branching in ring-on-ring glass disks. Particularly interesting is the fractal nature of the crack branching coefficient as well as the possibility of distilling the fracture pattern into simpler structural components. Density Functional Theoretical Computation of the Raman Spectrum of Pyrolusite and other Manganese polymorphs: (with Luis Aguinaga Del Hierro and David McKeown) Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful computational tool that is widely used in the study of materials. DFT is a mathematical approach that is used to describe the behavior of electrons in materials, and it is based on the concept that the total energy of a system of electrons can be expressed as a functional of the system's electron density. This allows researchers to study the electronic structure of materials at the atomic level, which is essential for understanding their physical and chemical properties. DFT is widely used in the field of materials science to predict the properties of new materials, to design materials with specific properties, and to study the behavior of materials under different conditions. The collaboration would like to use DFT to predict and compute the Raman spectrum of particularly complicated manganese polymorphs to compare to experimental measurements done by David McKeown and Jeff Post. The Effects of Warping on Electronic Band Structures: (with Lorenzo Resca) The electronic band structure of materials is an important concept in materials science because it provides insight into the behavior of electrons within a material. The band structure refers to the arrangement of energy levels that electrons occupy within a solid. It can be used to predict the electrical and thermal conductivity of a material, as well as its optical and magnetic properties. Understanding the electronic band structure is therefore essential for designing materials with specific properties and for optimizing their performance in various applications. Various physical properties can be derived from derivatives and features of the band structure. In this research the consequences of non-analytic points in the electronic band structure of materials is explored. Electrodynamic measurement and device design for velocity measurement in the Earth’s magnetic field: The Earth’s magnetic field is a resource that may be used in a number of ways to provide some indication of location and speed information in moving bodies. In this research the feasibility and mathematics necessary to design velocity measurement devices based on the Lorentz force law of electromagnetism is established and investigated.",

She is focusing on chronicles written at eastern English monasteries in the aftermath of the great upheavals of the Norman Conquest and the civil war of King Stephen’s reign, in which monastic compilers deployed every resource at their command to distinguish themselves from rival houses and defend themselves against the sometimes aggressive claims of lay lords and even bishops. Dr. Paxton is also working on a further project that examines changing views of abbatial leadership across the Anglo-Norman world in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Click here for vita .",

On the Edge: Global Transformations in the Medieval Egyptian Countryside , Dr. Weitz's current book project, explores how the Muslim and Christian societies of an out-of-the-way corner of Egypt experienced global trends— the expansion of Islam, the rise of Arabic, trade and slavery across the Nile and Sahara—that transformed Afro-Eurasia on either side of the year 1000.

His articles on Propertius and Prudentius have been published in Hermes (v. 109: 196-206), Vigiliae Christianae (v. 36: 282-86), and Classica et Mediaevalia (v. 40: 213-25); other publications include contributions to Festschriften for R.

Dr. McCarthy’s current research projects focus centrally upon rhetoric, broadly defined: in addition to his ongoing work on the homiletics of John Chrysostom and the reception of Hellenistic poetics by Gregory Nazianzus, he is also engaged in the study of the visual rhetoric of early and modern cinema and its indebtedness to the literary rhetorical patterns established in classical antiquity, and regularly presents at interdisciplinary conferences focused on both literature and film. He also bears a long-term interest in the application of new technologies to the study of literature. At present, he is working on an essay for a collection on madness and insanity in the Patristic period, examining certain concerns of Galen and the pneumatic school of medicine (including pharmacology, diet, and language theory) in conjunction with the evolution of the doctrine of the Holy Spirit. Dr. McCarthy held a university fellowship at Ohio State and a Hochwald endowment fellowship at CUA during his graduate studies before being named adjunct assistant professor in 1984, assistant professor in 1985, and associate professor in 1991. Within the Department of Ancient and Medieval Languages and Cultures, he teaches upper-level reading courses in both Greek and Latin, as well as regularly offering a highly popular undergraduate course entitled \"The Ancient World in Cinema.\"",

    "bio": "Dr. Pagani is a specialist in the interactions between Classical and Christian learning in the Middle Ages, both West and East. His research interests focus specifically upon the reception of Greek philosophy (mainly Plato and Aristotle) during the Latin Middle Ages through the Italian Renaissance, with particular attention to the roles played by Byzantine intellectuals. Dr. Pagani’s Ph.D. dissertation was dedicated to the intellectual quarrel about Platonism that took place in Rome between George of Trebizond and Cardinal Bessarion in the mid-fifteenth century. His work not only included an edition of the Latin text of book I-IV of George’s translation and Bessarion’s comments, but also demonstrated that translations played a significant role in triggering (and shaping) philosophical discussions about how Platonism might be made compatible with Thomistic interpretations of Aristotle. As part of another large-scale project, Dr. Pagani's recent discovery of Gemistos Pletho’s copy of Plato’s dialogues allowed him to demonstrate that Gemistos produced his own working edition of Plato by erasing (and therefore censoring) passages for reasons connected to his own distinctive philosophical and religious outlook. Outside of Catholic University, Dr. Pagani is also employed (on leave) by the long-term project Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca et Byzantina in Berlin, where he works on the reception of Aristotle's Metaphysics in Byzantium, particularly upon the role played by the late thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century scholar George Pachymeres. Dr. Pagani has been an Onassis Fellow in Athens (2009-10) and a fellow at the Warburg Institute, London (fall 2010). During academic year 2015-16 he held fellowships at Dumbarton Oaks (Washington, D.C.) and at Princeton (Seeger Center for Hellenic Studies). Due to his broad interest in the reception of antiquity in later periods, he is a member of the Princeton-based 'Postclassicisms' network. Dr. Pagani was appointed at Catholic University as Visiting Assistant Professor in 2016, and as Assistant Professor in 2017. He teaches courses in both classical and medieval Greek and Latin language and literature.",

Inositol-based signalling is ubiquitous in human cells and its dysregulation has been linked with disease states. Our goal is to understand how these kinases and phosphatases produce highly specific inositol signals and how they elicit their effects in cells. To do this, we study the structures of IP- and PI- kinases and phosphatases, their catalytic mechanisms, and how their actions are regulated in the cell. We use x-ray crystallography to determine high-resolution structures of these enzymes and protein engineering to correlate the structure of each enzyme with its catalytic function and their downstream effects. We also use proteomics to identify cellular interactions between these enzymes with other proteins, which provides a cellular context for their actions. Using these approaches we generate a clear understanding of the functions of these kinases and phosphatases and we also obtain high-resolution structures to facilitate inhibitor design efforts to target inositol-based signalling networks.",

Considering that proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions are an extension of the ordinary oxidation/reduction (redox) reactions in chemistry, there is a substantial gap in knowledge when we compare the number of metal-based catalysts engaging in PCET transformations and the number of metal-based reagents capable of PCET chemistry that have either their thermochemistry or kinetics characterized. This, in turn, limits the rational improvement of the current generation of catalysts, independently of the reaction they catalyze. My research interest is to fill this gap by aggregating the currently available knowledge of PCET catalysts and reagents and developing new molecules with enhanced properties.",

He specializes in modern Irish and British literature, and he publishes in the fields of classical reception and comparative modernism. His research is especially invested in documenting the prominent afterlives of Greek and Roman antiquity within literary avant-garde movements of the twentieth century. Dr. Baker's book, Classics and Celtic Literary Modernism: Yeats, Joyce, MacDiarmid and Jones , appeared with Cambridge University Press in February 2022. It examines the work of W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, David Jones and Hugh MacDiarmid at length, showing how new forms of modernist literary expression emerged in their creative work, as the evolution of classical education, the insurgent power of cultural nationalisms and the desire for artistic transformation converged across Ireland, Scotland and Wales . In addition to this study, other publications include work on the Scottish nationalist, classicist and translator, Douglas Young , as well as the annotated bibliography for volume 5 of The Oxford History of Classical Reception in English Literature . His current research explores how Greek and Latin learning, and the broad cultural expectations surrounding classics, impacted post-World War II Irish, African, Caribbean and Antipodean poetry. His work counterpoints, comparatively, the interactions of different institutional and artistic forms of classical reception in this period—a time of profound political change and stylistic experimentation due, in part, to the decolonization of the British imperial state. Dr. Baker directs the interdisciplinary undergraduate program for Irish Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. He also teaches a regular rotation of courses focused on twentieth-century Irish and British literature. In past semesters he has taught classes on the history of drama, and on the history of the novel, on the work of Geoffrey Hill and of Seamus Heaney, on the poetry of world war, and on the major writings of W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound and James Joyce. Dr. Baker earned his doctorate in Comparative Literature at Brown University. His undergraduate degree was in Classical Studies at the University of Chicago.

His articles and review essays on Milton, Spenser, Tasso, Empson, Ariosto, Browne, Herbert, Donne, Montaigne and others have appeared in ELH , Renaissance Quarterly , SEL , Milton Studies, Modern Philology, Huntington Library Quarterly , Journal of British Studies , Religion and Literature and the London Review of Books . Awards include fellowships from the ACLS, Huntington,and Folger, and the Isabel MacCaffrey Prize of the International Spenser Society. Dr. Gregory's first book From Many Gods to One: Divine Action in Renaissance Epic (Chicago, 2006) examines how Renaissance poets approached the problem of epic divine action: how to replace the Olympian gods of Homer and Virgil? Drawing on scholarship in several disciplines--religion, classics, history, and philosophy, as well as literature--the book sheds new light on two subjects of enduring importance in Renaissance studies: the precarious balance between classical literary models and Christian religious norms, and the role of religion in drawing lines between allies and others.",

She studies the intersections of visual culture and literature; epigraphy and inscribed objects; myth and religion in the Viking Age; and the art of commemoration. Her monograph, Gods and Settlers: The Iconography of Norse Mythology in Anglo-Scandinavian Sculpture (Brepols 2012), examines the influence of Norse mythological and heroic narratives on stone carvings of Viking Age England, and evaluates the sculptural evidence for the process of cultural integration and conversion of Scandinavian settlers.

    "bio": "Megan Murton is a medievalist and specializes in the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, with a particular interest in his poetry's engagement with philosophical thought and devotional prace. Her first monograph, Chaucer's Prayers: Writing Christian and Pagan Devotion , examines Chaucer's use of prayer as a distinctive kind of voice in his poetry. Emphasizing the performative quality of prayers as utterances that ask to be prayed, rather than simply read, this book argues that Chaucer uses prayer to enlist readers' participation in his poetry and to guide their responses to it. The book was reviewed in scholarly journals including Studies in the Age of Chaucer , Speculum , and Journal of Medieval Religious Cultures . Dr Murton's current book project re-evaluates the pervasive influence of Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy on Chaucer. Founded on a revisionist reading of Boethius, in which his consolation is devotional as well as philosophical, this book proposes a new way to understand how Chaucer drew on Boethius when writing about suffering, injustice, and especially, love. It also looks beyond Chaucer to explore how he mediated Boethian thought to such figures as Thomas Usk, Robert Henryson, John Walton, and James I of Scotland. Dr. Murton presented early work toward this project at several events commemorating the 1500th anniversary of Boethius's death in 2024, including the Drumwright Lecture at Baylor University. In addition to her scholarly work, Dr. Murton serves as Director of Graduate Studies for the Department of English, as a member of the Academic Senate at The Catholic University of America, and as Humanities Consultant for The Boethius Project , a public-humanities initiative. Prior to her work at Catholic University, Dr. Murton taught Middle English language and literature at the University of Cambridge, as well as literature and academic writing courses at Xavier University and Miami University of Ohio. At Catholic University, she teaches a range of undergraduate courses, including History of British Literature I, Chaucer and His Age I & II, Arthurian Literature, and Transformative Texts, as well as graduate seminars on literary theory and medieval literature. In addition to the works of Chaucer and his contemporaries, her teaching interests include Middle English mystical and devotional writings, medieval French and Italian literature, the history of the English language, and modern-day medievalism. Dr. Murton has been interviewed by CUA students about her passion for teaching medieval literature and mentoring students ( part 1 , part 2 ). Dr. Murton received her Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge. She also holds a joint Bachelor’s degree in Linguistics and French Literature from Harvard University and a Master’s degree in Medieval English Literature from the University of Oxford.",

Based extensively on the surviving manuscripts of Frankish capitularies, the book examines how and why various communities copied and used royal law for their own purposes.

His work focuses on the experiences of Irish and Scottish Gaelic and American Indigenous peoples. His recently published book, The Gaelic and Indian Origins of the American Revolution: Diversity and Empire in the British Atlantic 1688-1783 (Oxford University Press), offers a new explanation of the origins of the American Revolution. The project draws on Irish- and Scots-Gaelic language and Indigenous American sources to show how colonized peoples tried to reshape empires in their own image, and how their partial success convinced American colonists to leave the British empire. He is also co-editor of a recent anthology of Irish-language poetry in historical context, Bone and Marrow/Cnámh agus Smior: An Anthology of Irish Poetry from Medieval to Modern ( Wake Forest University Press).

    "bio": "Lev Weitz is an historian of the Islamic Middle East. His scholarly interests lie in the encounters among Muslims, Christians, and Jews that have shaped the Middle East’s history from the coming of Islam to the present, which he engages in his research and in the classroom. Dr. Weitz's book Between Christ and Caliph: Law, Marriage, and Christian Community in Early Islam (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018) examines the multiconfessional society of early Islam through the lens of shifting marital practices of Syriac Christian communities, arguing that interreligious negotiations lie at the heart of the history of the medieval Islamic empire. On the Edge: Global Transformations in the Medieval Egyptian Countryside , Dr. Weitz's current book project, explores how the Muslim and Christian societies of an out-of-the-way corner of Egypt experienced global trends— the expansion of Islam, the rise of Arabic, trade and slavery across the Nile and Sahara—that transformed Afro-Eurasia on either side of the year 1000. At Catholic University, Dr. Weitz teaches a range of courses on Middle Eastern and Mediterranean history from the Middle Ages to modernity. Click here for vita .

He has two current research projects: the first investigates the \"difficult heritage\" of small villages and farmhouses constructed under Italy’s Fascist regime in the 1930s and 1940s, while the second uses participatory GIS (PGIS) to reveal how farmers and winemakers in key areas across Italy are adopting or adapting traditional cultivation techniques in response to global climate change. In addition to his work in Italy, Dr. Samuels has conducted fieldwork in Crete, the mid-Atlantic States, Arizona, and California, in time periods ranging from the Iron Age to the present day. Dr. Samuels teaches Cultures in a Global Society (ANTH 101), Introduction to Archaeology (ANTH 108), Anthropological Research Design and Conduct (ANTH 201), The Anthropology of Food (ANTH 214), Politics of the Past: An Introduction to Cultural Heritage Studies (ANTH 240), Legislating Heritage: Domestic Law and International Conventions (ANTH 290), GIS for the Social Scienes (ANTH 353), and the Archaeology of Settlements and Landscapes (ANTH 354). Dr. Samuels received his Ph.D. from Stanford University’s Department of Anthropology in 2013, and an M.Sc. in Archaeomaterials from the University of Sheffield in 2004. Before coming to Catholic University, he taught anthropology and archaeology courses at Stanford University and North Dakota State University, and worked as a GIS Specialist in Cultural Resource Management (CRM). His research has been supported by the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, and the Barbieri Endowment at Trinity College. View CV",

We are particularly focused on a suicide-focused clinical treatment developed in the SPL called the \"Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality\" (CAMS). We are presently engaged in funded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate the effectiveness of CAMS with patients in the US and abroad. There are now eleven published open clinical trials, seven published RCTs, and two meta- analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of CAMS. There are five ongoing RCTs and several other trials are being developed abroad. I have been working in suicidology since graduate school across various domains—public health, clinical research, epidemiology, and theory- building. I have also worked extensively within Veterans Affairs and I have been a consultant to each branch of the US military. In recent years my lab has become increasingly focused on teenagers who are suicidal as we continued to adapt CAMS for other populations. I am also deeply involved in suicide and mental health policy, advocacy, and legislation at the national, state, and local levels. As a professor I teach courses in clinical psychology, ethics and professional practice, psychotherapy, research methods, clinical theory, assessment interviewing, and the psychology of living. I have a passion for teaching and my courses are infused with real-world examples and case studies that help bring course material to life.",

As a pediatric psychologist, I strive to support families beyond the alleviation of suffering by promoting positive health and well-being. Thus, my research focuses on child, emerging adult, and family adjustment to complex and life-threatening pediatric health conditions. The primary goals of my research are to identify factors that predict adjustment difficulties and resilience, and develop interventions to promote positive health outcomes. My work is informed by the biopsychosocial model of health with a developmental-ecological perspective. I utilize a variety of research methodologies (e.g., mixed-methods designs, longitudinal assessments, person-centered analytic approaches) to understand the multidimensional influences on health. Recent projects I have conducted aimed to identify modifiable factors, such as cognitive appraisals and socioeconomic resources, that predict neurodevelopmental outcomes and family coping in pediatric cancer. My overall research mission is to develop an integrated model of care to promote positive health for families impacted by complex medical conditions.",

Overall, the FDA regulates more than $2.4 trillion worth of consumer goods, about 25% of consumer expenditures in the United States. This includes $466 billion in food sales, $275 billion in drugs, $60 billion in cosmetics and $18 billion in vitamin and dietary supplements. Much of these expenditures are for goods imported into the United States; the FDA is responsible for monitoring imports, but only rarely does its own independent quality control in the form of laboratory testing of imported Chinese and Indian pharmaceuticals. Dr. Gortler is trained as a pharmacologist, pharmacist and is a Yale University -trained bench research scientist in molecular biology with a subspecialty in the field of lipid metabolism. He was later hired as professor of pharmacology and biotechnology at the Yale University School of Medicine's Department of Pharmacology from 2004-2008, where he also served at Yale’s Center for Bioethics. He was hired as an FDA Medical Officer from 2007-2011 and later as an Associate Professor of Pharmacology at Georgetown University from 2010-2014, and was later appointed to serve on the FDA’s Senior Executive Leadership Team as senior advisor to the FDA Commissioner . He also conceptualized and founded the world’s first “analytical pharmacy” which tested overseas-made drugs from India and China for purity and quality control and served as the editor-in-chief and on the editorial board of multiple specialty journals covering FDA findings and investigational medicine. He is also an advocate for reducing or eliminating of FDA-mandated cruel animal testing in favor of state-of-the-art OOC \"animal free\" testing.",

Her work extends beyond the corporate realm, as she has also provided strategic guidance, conducted research, and authored grant proposals for Catholic organizations. Dr. Pak's passion is exploring the human experience from a variety of perspectives. Research interests include emerging consumer markets, technological innovation across industries, scholarship of teaching and learning, character formation in emerging adults, and the integration of personal identity with ethical frameworks in evolving contexts. Published across diverse fields—including business, trade research, international studies, and military medicine—she continues to provide thought leadership in marketing and beyond. Her recent framework on the Sandwich Generation was published in the Journal of Business Strategy (2024) and is the first of its kind in a peer-reviewed journal to guide companies on how to better reach and serve this elusive consumer. In addition to her business research, she is also developing work in her other fields. Currently, she is completing a book in her spare time, Being in Utero, which proposes that the womb can be spoken of as a theological place of revelation, filiation, communion, preparation, and calling. It also explores what it means to be inside another person during our earliest stages of development, and how that experience may impact us for the rest of our lives. Dr. Pak completed her doctoral coursework in Marketing at Boston University and holds a BS in Biology from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, an MBA in Management Information Systems from The George Washington University, an MA in Theology from Villanova University, and a Ph.D. in Religion/Culture from The Catholic University of America.",

For example, her mixed methods study and resultant actions in an academic medical center, using a stakeholder team to evaluate a RN-BSN academic progression program, impacted the percentage of BSN-prepared nurses from 61% to 80%. She has also published/presented on topics for improved patient outcomes, including multidisciplinary rounds, patient flow, and evidence-based practice/evidence-based design. As an undergraduate nursing alumnus of The Catholic University of America, Dr. Dixon’s professional practice has been guided by her Catholic faith and education; her vocation remains grounded in her unwavering respect for human life and in service to others, especially the most vulnerable and underserved.",

    "bio": "Jonathan Buttaci is a native of Pittsburgh, PA where, after growing up in North Carolina, he later returned to complete a Ph.D. in philosophy. His research concerns theories of knowledge, learning, and the soul in ancient Greek philosophy. He is particularly interested in Aristotle’s account of scientific knowledge, inquiry, and discovery as shown in his (often neglected) scientific works. A key question driving Dr. Buttaci's research is the relationship between perception, habituation, and other strictly non-intellectual forms of cognition (on the one hand), and properly intellectual activities and achievements (on the other). In his research, he looks not only to Aristotle’s scientific works to understand the interplay between intellectual and non-intellectual human activities, but also to the Rhetoric and Poetics . Man is, after all, the most mimetic of animals, accomplishing his first steps toward learning by mimēsis. Dr. Buttaci is also interested in more recent philosophical debates on similar topics in the philosophy of mind, philosophy of knowledge, and philosophy of science. He has research projects at various stages engaging with the work of Newman, Geach, Sellars, and McDowell from the perspective of his work on Aristotle. He enjoys hiking the forests of Appalachia while puzzling over the paradox of the Meno , the battle rout of Posterior Analytics B.19, the intellect(s) of de Anima III.5, and the ascent to wisdom in Metaphysics A.1.

Massey’s research interests include the school-to-prison pipeline, critical race theory (CRT) applications to policy and practice, and bridging micro/macro practice. For his dissertation, entitled Critical Race Examination of Educator Perceptions of Discipline and School-Wide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports , he thematically analyzed educator interviews at one high school in the preliminary stages of implementing School-wide Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS), a preventive disciplinary framework. Using a CRT analytical lens to center issues of race and racism, findings revealed that while educators promoted positive and preventative discipline, they also described a school in which discipline is one thread in a complex web of Whiteness. These findings suggest that SWPBIS has the potential to support alternatives to punitive discipline, but faces multiple barriers in addressing racial disciplinary disproportionality. Full CV",

Hobelman Chair in Catholic Moral Theology, with a specialization in fundamental Catholic moral theology, virtue ethics, and the moral theology of St. Thomas Aquinas. He received his Ph.D. in moral theology at the University of Notre Dame in 2014, and was awarded a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship as Research Associate in Theological Ethics at the University of Cambridge, coming to CUA in 2017. He is the author of one monograph and eighteen journal articles and book chapters invited or already in print. Elliot’s first book, Hope and Christian Ethics (Cambridge University Press, 2017) offered a Thomistic account of how Christian hope contributes to human happiness and the common good while aiming at eternal beatitude. It received highly positive book reviews and was described as “a uniquely significant contribution to Christian ethics” and setting “a benchmark for studies in virtue ethics.” His second book project on “spiritual training” focuses on the crucial role St. Thomas Aquinas assigns to moral and spiritual practices in the growth of Christian virtue, allowing us to see a deeply rewarding practical side to the “common and universal Doctor of the Church.” Elliot has taught moral theology at the Catholic University, Notre Dame, and Cambridge University, and co-organized academic conferences at each. He is the co-editor for a scholarly volume with CUA Press and co-edited a special SCE journal issue on “Virtue, Habit, and Grace in Thomas Aquinas.” He also serves as an IHE Scholar at the Institute for Human Ecology, is on the CUA Press Editorial Committee, is an Editorial Board member of Studies in Christian Ethics , and recently completed a 3-year term on the leadership of the Thomas Aquinas Consultation of the Catholic Theological Society of America. From 2015-2022 Elliot was a Research Associate (non-residential) of the Von Hügel Institute, University of Cambridge. He has been awarded multiple grants and fellowships, including “The Character Essay and Book Prize” by the Templeton Foundation funded Character Project for contributions to the study of character. In Spring 2024 Elliot was installed as the inaugural Grace P. Hobelman Endowed Chair in Catholic Moral Theology.",

    "bio": "Dr. Chad Pecknold received his PhD from the University of Cambridge (UK) in 2005 and since 2008 he has been a Professor of Historical & Systematic Theology in the School of Theology at The Catholic University of America in Washington, DC. Pecknold has authored or edited five books, each relating the thought of St. Augustine to modern philosophical and theological reasoning, including, Transforming Postliberal Theology (2005), The Promise of Scriptural Reasoning (2006), Time, Liturgy, and the Politics of Redemption (2008), Christianity and Politics (2010) and the T&T Clark Companion to Augustine and Modern Theology (2014). He teaches in the areas of fundamental theology, Christian anthropology, and political theology. In fundamental theology he brings Augustine’s rejection of skepticism and embrace of metaphysical accounts of causality to bear on modern skepticism and metaphysical agnosticism. In Christian anthropology, Pecknold focuses especially on 20th century nature-grace disputes, and the relationship between Augustinian and Thomistic distinctions between natural and supernatural orders. In political theology, Pecknold is principally concerned with close readings of Augustine’s masterwork, The City of God , as a fundamental and transcendent vision that inspires, and has the power to critique and correct, the dynamics of Western civilization. Professor Pecknold is also a frequent contributor to debates in the public square. He writes weekly columns as the U.S. Contributing Editor to The Catholic Herald, one of the oldest Catholic magazines in the world, and also writes regularly for other publications, such as First Things, Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, and National Review on a range of timely topics related to the importance and impact of Church teaching on social and political questions. Professor Pecknold is frequently sought after for his opinion on current events, and has been quoted in hundreds of news outlets around the world such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. He has appeared as an invited guest on radio and television shows from NPR’s “All Things Considered” to EWTN News Nightly offering his clear analysis and expert opinion on the Catholic Church, the papacy, and the relationship between the Church and politics in American culture. Pecknold serves on the Editorial Board of The Catholic University of America Press, and also co-edits with Fr. Thomas Joseph White, O.P., their celebrated Sacra Doctrina series. He serves as an Associate Editor for the English Edition of the international Thomistic journal of theology, Nova et Vetera. He serves as Chairman of the Academy of Catholic Theology, and has the honor of serving as a Fellow of the Institute for Human Ecology at Catholic University. Dr Pecknold is currently writing a book on a Catholic understanding of Augustine’s City of God.
